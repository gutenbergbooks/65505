<p class="p2"><span class="sc">In</span> the preparation of the revised edition of the late Dr. Engel’s
handbook, first published in 1875, care has been taken to make
as few alterations as possible and to express no views from
which he might have dissented.</p>

<p>The greatly enlarged chapter relating to post-mediæval
instruments has been chiefly compiled from Dr. Engel’s
Descriptive Catalogue of the musical instruments in the
Museum, published in 1874.</p>

<p>The pages relating to the Ancient Egyptians have been
revised by Dr. W. M. Flinders Petrie, those dealing with the
Greeks, Etruscans and Romans by Dr. Cecil H. Smith, and
the description of Chinese and Japanese instruments by Dr.
Stephen W. Bushell. The thanks of the Board are due to
these gentlemen for their valuable co-operation.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.</h3>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="One">I.</abbr></h3>

<h4 class="h4head">INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Music</span>, in however primitive a stage of development it may
be with some nations, is universally appreciated as one of the
Fine Arts. The origin of vocal music may have been coeval
with that of language; and the construction of musical
instruments evidently dates with the earliest inventions
which suggested themselves to human ingenuity. There
exist even at the present day some savage tribes in Australia
and South America who, although they have no more than
the five first numerals in their language and are thereby unable
to count the fingers of both hands together, nevertheless
possess musical instruments of their own contrivance, with
which they accompany their songs and dances.</p>

<p>Wood, metal, and the hide of animals are the most common
substances used in the construction of musical instruments.
In tropical countries bamboo or some similar kind of cane
and gourds are especially made use of for this purpose. The
ingenuity of man has contrived to employ in producing music,
horn, bone, glass, pottery, slabs of sonorous stone&mdash;&#8203;in fact,
almost all vibrating matter. The strings of instruments
have been made of the hair of animals, of silk, the runners of
creeping plants, the fibrous roots of certain trees, of cane,
catgut (which, absurdly referred to the cat, is from the sheep,
goat, lamb, camel, and some other animals), metal, etc.</p>

<p><!--Pg 013--><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><span class="pageno">2</span>
The mode in which individual nations or tribes are in the
habit of embellishing their musical instruments is sometimes
as characteristic as it is singular. The negroes in several
districts of Western Africa affix to their drums human skulls.
A war-trumpet of the king of Ashantee which was brought
to England is surrounded by human jawbones. The Maoris
in New Zealand carve around the mouth-hole of their trumpets
a figure intended, it is said, to represent female lips. The
materials for ornamentation chiefly employed by savages
are bright colours, beads, shells, grasses, the bark of trees,
feathers, stones, gilding, pieces of looking-glass inlaid like
mosaic, etc. Uncivilised nations are sure to consider anything
which is bright and glittering ornamental, especially if it
is also scarce. Captain Tuckey saw in Congo a negro instrument
which was ornamented with part of the broken frame
of a looking-glass, to which were affixed in a semicircle a
number of brass buttons with the head of Louis <abbr title="Sixteen">XVI.</abbr>. on them,&mdash;&#8203;perhaps
a relic of some French sailor drowned near the
coast years ago.</p>

<p>Again, musical instruments are not infrequently formed
in the shape of certain animals. Thus, a kind of harmonicon
of the Chinese represents the figure of a crouching tiger.
The Burmese possess a stringed instrument in the shape of
an alligator. Even more grotesque are the imitations of
various beasts adopted by the Javanese. The natives of
New Guinea have a singularly shaped drum, terminating in
the head of a reptile. A wooden rattle like a bird is a favourite
instrument of the Indians of Nootka Sound. In short, not
only the inner construction of the instruments and their
peculiar quality of sound exhibit in most nations certain
distinctive characteristics, but it is also in great measure
true as to their outward appearance.</p>

<p>An arrangement of the various kinds of musical instruments
<!--Pg 014--><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><span class="pageno">3</span>
in a regular order, beginning with that kind which is
the most universally known, and progressing gradually to the
least usual, gives the following results. Instruments of
percussion of indefinite sonorousness or, in other words,
pulsatile instruments which have not a sound of a fixed pitch,
as the drum, rattle, castanets, etc., are most universal. Wind
instruments of the flute kind&mdash;&#8203;including pipes, whistles, flutes,
Pandean pipes, etc.&mdash;&#8203;are also to be found almost everywhere.</p>

<p>Much the same is the case with wind instruments of the
trumpet kind. These are often made of the horns, bones,
and tusks of animals; frequently of vegetable substances
and of metal. Instruments of percussion of definite sonorousness
are chiefly met with in China, Japan, Burmah, Siam,
and Java. They not infrequently contain a series of tones
produced by slabs of wood or metal, which are beaten with
a sort of hammer, as our harmonicon is played.</p>

<p>Stringed instruments without a finger board, or any similar
contrivance which enables the performer to produce a number
of different tones on one string, are generally found among
nations whose musical accomplishments have emerged from
the earliest state of infancy. The strings are twanged with
the fingers or with a piece of wood, horn, metal, or any other
suitable substance serving as a <dfn>plectrum</dfn>; or are made to vibrate
by being beaten with a hammer, as our dulcimer. Stringed
instruments provided with a finger-board on which different
tones are producible on one string by the performer shortening
it more or less&mdash;&#8203;as on the guitar and violin&mdash;&#8203;are met with
almost exclusively among nations in a somewhat advanced
stage of musical progress. Such as are played with a bow
are the least common; they are, however, known to the
Chinese, Japanese, Hindus, Persians, Arabs, and a few other
nations, besides those of Europe and their descendants in
other countries.</p>

<p><!--Pg 015--><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pageno">4</span>
Wind instruments of the organ kind&mdash;&#8203;<span class="decoration">i.e.</span>, such as are constructed
of a number of tubes which can be sounded together
by means of a common mouthpiece or some similar contrivance,
and upon which therefore chords and combinations
of chords, or harmony, can be produced&mdash;&#8203;are comparatively
of rare occurrence. Some interesting specimens of them
exist in China, Japan, Laos, and Siam.</p>

<p>Besides these various kinds of sound-producing means
employed in musical performances, a few others less widely
diffused could be pointed out, which are of a construction not
represented in any of our well-known European specimens.
For instance, some nations have peculiar instruments of
friction, which can hardly be classed with our instruments of
percussion. Again, there are contrivances in which a number
of strings are caused to vibrate by a current of air much
as is the case with the Æolian harp; which might with equal
propriety be considered either as stringed instruments or
as wind instruments. In short, our usual classification of
all the various species into three distinct divisions, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>,
<dfn>Stringed Instruments</dfn>, <dfn>Wind Instruments</dfn>, and <dfn>Instruments
of Percussion</dfn>, is not tenable if we extend our researches over
the whole globe.</p>

<p>The collection at South Kensington contains several foreign
instruments which cannot fail to prove interesting to the
musician. Recent investigations have more and more
elicited the fact that the music of every nation exhibits some
distinctive characteristics which may afford valuable hints
to a composer or performer. A familiarity with the popular
songs of different countries is advisable on account of the
remarkable originality of the airs; these mostly spring from
the heart. Hence the natural and true expression, the
delightful health and vigour by which they are generally
distinguished. Our more artificial compositions are, on the
<!--Pg 016--><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><span class="pageno">5</span>
other hand, not infrequently deficient in these charms,
because they often emanate from the lingers or the pen rather
than from the heart. Howbeit, the predominance of expressive
melody and effective rhythm over harmonious combinations,
so usual in the popular compositions of various
nations, would alone suffice to recommend them to the careful
attention of our modern musicians. The same may be said
with regard to the surprising variety in construction and in
manner of expression prevailing in the popular songs and
dance-tunes of different countries. Indeed, every nation’s
musical effusions exhibit a character peculiarly their own,
with which the musician would find it advantageous to
familiarise himself.</p>

<p>Now, it will easily be understood that an acquaintance with
the musical instruments of a nation conveys a more correct
idea than could otherwise be obtained of the characteristic
features of the nation’s musical compositions. Furthermore,
in many instances the construction of the instruments reveals
to us the nature of the musical intervals, scales, modulations,
and suchlike noteworthy facts. True, inquiries like these
have hitherto not received from musicians the attention
which they deserve. The adepts in most other arts are in this
respect in advance. They are convinced that useful information
may be gathered by investigating the productions even
of uncivilised nations, and by thus tracing the gradual progress
of an art from its primitive infancy to its highest degree of
development.</p>

<p>Again, from an examination of the musical instruments of
foreign nations we may derive valuable hints for the improvement
of our own; or even for the invention of new. Several
principles of construction have thus been adopted by us from
eastern nations. For instance, the <dfn>free reed</dfn> used in the
harmonium is an importation from China. The organ builder
<!--Pg 017--><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pageno">6</span>
Kratzenstein, who lived in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petersburg during the reign
of Catherine <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, happened to see the Chinese instrument <dfn>cheng</dfn>,
which is of this construction, and it suggested to him, about
the end of the 18th century, to apply the <dfn>free reed</dfn> to certain
organ stops. At the present day instruments of the harmonium
class have become such universal favourites in
western Europe as almost to compete with the pianoforte.</p>

<p>Several other well-authenticated instances could be cited
in which one instrument has suggested the construction of
another of a superior kind. The prototype of our pianoforte
was evidently the dulcimer, known at an early time to the
Arabs and Persians, who call it <dfn>santir</dfn>. One of the old names
given to the dulcimer by European nations is <dfn>cimbal</dfn>. The
Poles at the present day call it <dfn>cymbaly</dfn>, and the Magyars in
Hungary <dfn>cimbalom</dfn>. The <dfn>clavicembalo</dfn>, the predecessor of
the pianoforte, was in fact nothing but a <dfn>cembalo</dfn> with a
key board attached to it; and some of the old <dfn>clavicembali</dfn>
still preserved, exhibit the trapezium shape, the round hole
in the middle of the sound-board, and other peculiarities of
the first dulcimer. Again, the gradual development of the
dulcimer from a rude contrivance, consisting merely of a
wooden board across which a few strings are stretched, is
distinctly traceable by a reference to the musical instruments
of nations in different stages of civilisation. The same is the
case with our highly perfected harp, of which curious specimens,
representing the instrument in its most primitive
condition, are still to be found among several barbarous
tribes. We might perhaps infer from its shape that it originally
consisted of nothing more than an elastic stick bent by a
string. The Damaras, a native tribe of South-western Africa,
actually use their bow occasionally as a musical instrument
when they are not engaged in war or in the chase. They
tighten the string nearly in the middle by means of a leathern
<!--Pg 018--><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><span class="pageno">7</span>
thong, whereby they obtain two distinct sounds, which, for
want of a sound board, are of course very weak and scarcely
audible to anyone but the performer. Some neighbouring
tribes, however, possess a musical instrument very similar in
appearance to the bow, to which they attach a gourd, hollowed
and open at the top, which serves as a sound-board. Again,
other African tribes have a similar instrument, superior
in construction only inasmuch as it contains more than one
string, and is provided with a sound-board consisting of a
suitable piece of sonorous wood. In short, the more improved
we find these contrivances the closer they approach our harp.
And it could be shown, if this were requisite for our present
purpose, that much the same gradual progress towards perfection,
which we observe in the African harp, is traceable
in the harps of several nations in different parts of the
world.</p>

<p>Moreover, a collection of musical instruments deserves the
attention of the ethnologist as much as of the musician.
Indeed, this may be asserted of national music in general;
for it gives us an insight into the heart of man, reveals to us
the feelings and predilections of different races on the globe,
and affords us a clue to the natural affinity which exists
between different families of men. Again, a collection
must prove interesting in a historical point of view. Scholars
will find among old instruments specimens which were in
common use in England at the time of Queen Elizabeth,
and which are not unfrequently mentioned in the literature
of that period. In many instances the passages in which
allusion is made to them can hardly be understood, if we are
unacquainted with the shape and construction of the instruments.
Furthermore, these relics of bygone times bring
before our eyes the manners and customs of our forefathers,
and assist us in understanding them correctly.</p>

<p><!--Pg 019--><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><span class="pageno">8</span>
It will be seen that the modification which our orchestra has
undergone, in the course of scarcely more than a century, is
great indeed. Most of the instruments which were highly
popular about a hundred years ago have either fallen into
disuse or are now so much altered that they may almost be
considered as new inventions. Among Asiatic nations, on
the other hand, we meet with several instruments which have
retained unchanged through many centuries their old construction
and outward appearance. At South Kensington
may be seen instruments still in use in Egypt and western
Asia, precisely like specimens represented on monuments
dating from a period of three thousand years ago. By a
reference to the Eastern instruments of the present time we
obtain therefore a key for investigating the earlier Egyptian
and Assyrian representations of musical performances; and
likewise, for appreciating more exactly the biblical records
respecting the music of the Hebrews. Perhaps these evidences
will convey to some inquirers a less high opinion than they
have hitherto entertained, regarding the musical accomplishments
of the Hebrew bands in the solemn processions of
King David or in Solomon’s temple; but the opinion will
be all the nearer to the truth.</p>

<p>There is another point of interest about such collections,
and especially that at South Kensington, which must not be
left unnoticed. Several instruments are remarkable on
account of their elegant shape and tasteful ornamentation.
This is particularly the case with some specimens from Asiatic
countries. The beautiful designs with which they are embellished
may afford valuable patterns for study and for
adoption in works of art.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">PRE-HISTORIC RELICS AND ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">A really</span> complete account of all the musical instruments
from the earliest time known to us would require much more
space than can here be afforded. We can attempt only
a concise historical survey. We venture to hope that the
illustrations interspersed throughout the text will to the
intelligent reader elucidate many facts which, for the reason
stated, are touched upon but cursorily.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Pre-Historic Relics.</span></p>

<p>A musical relic has been exhumed in the department of
Dordogne in France, which was constructed in an age when
the fauna of France included the reindeer, the rhinoceros
and the mammoth, the hyæna, the bear, and the cave-lion.
It is a small bone somewhat less than two inches in length,
in which is a hole, evidently bored by means of one of the
little flint knives which men used before acquaintance with
the employment of metal for tools and weapons.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span>
 Many
of these flints were found in the same place with the bones.
Only about half a dozen of the bones, of which a considerable
number have been exhumed, possess the artificial hole.</p>

<p>M. Lartet surmises the perforated bone to have been used
as a whistle in hunting animals. It is the first digital phalanx
of a ruminant, drilled to a certain depth by a smooth cylindrical
bore on its lower surface near the expanded upper
articulation. On applying it to the lower lip and blowing
into it a shrill sound is yielded. Three of these phalanges are
<!--Pg 021--><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pageno">10</span>
of reindeer, one is of chamois. Again, among the relics
which have been brought to light from the cave of Lombrive,
in the department of Ariège, occur several eye-teeth of the
dog, which have a hole drilled into them near the root. Probably
they also yield sounds, like those reindeer bones, or
like the tube of a key. Another whistle&mdash;&#8203;or rather a pipe,
for it has three finger-holes by means of which different tones
could be produced&mdash;&#8203;was found in a burying-place, dating
from the stone period, in the vicinity of Poitiers in France;
it is rudely constructed from a fragment of stag’s horn. It
is blown at the end, like a <dfn>flûte à bec</dfn>, and the three-finger holes
are placed equidistantly. Four distinct tones must have
been easily obtainable on it: the lowest, when all the finger-holes
were covered; the other three, by opening the finger-holes
successively. From the character of the stone utensils
and weapons discovered with this pipe it is conjectured that
the burying-place from which it was exhumed dates from
the latest time of the stone age. Therefore, however old it
may be, it is a more recent contrivance than the reindeer-bone
whistle from the cavern of the Dordogne.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The Ancient Egyptians.</span></p>

<p>The most ancient nations historically known possessed
musical instruments which, though in acoustic construction
greatly inferior to our own, exhibit a degree of perfection
which could have been attained only after a long period of
cultivation. Many tribes of the present day have not yet
reached this stage of musical progress.</p>

<p>As regards the instruments of the ancient Egyptians we
now possess perhaps more detailed information than of those
appertaining to any other nation of antiquity. This information
we owe especially to the exactness with which the instruments
are depicted in sculptures and paintings<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>
. Whoever
has examined these interesting monuments with even ordinary
care cannot but be convinced that the representations which
they exhibit are faithful transcripts from life. Moreover, if
there remained any doubt respecting the accuracy of the
representations of the musical instruments it might be dispelled
by existing evidence. Several specimens have been
discovered in tombs, preserved in a more or less perfect
condition.</p>

<p>The Egyptians possessed various kinds of harps, some of
which were elegantly shaped and tastefully ornamented.
The largest were about 6½ feet high; and the small ones
frequently had some sort of stand which enabled the performer
to play upon the instrument while standing. The
name of the harp was <dfn>bene</dfn>. Its frame had no front pillar;
the tension of the strings therefore cannot have been anything
like so strong as on our present harp. (<a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2</a>.)</p>

<p>The Egyptian harps most remarkable for elegance of form
and elaborate decoration are the two which were first noticed
by Bruce who found them painted in fresco on the walls of a
sepulchre at Thebes, supposed to be the tomb of Rameses <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>
who reigned about 1170 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> Bruce’s discovery created a
sensation among musicians. The fact that at so remote an
age the Egyptians should have possessed harps which vie with
our own in elegance and beauty of form appeared to some
so incredible that the correctness of Bruce’s representations,
as engraved in his “Travels,” was greatly doubted. Sketches
of the same harps, taken subsequently and at different times
from the frescoes, have since been published, but they differ
more or less from each other in appearance and in the number
of strings. A kind of triangular harp of the Egyptians was
<!--Pg 025--><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pageno">12</span>
discovered in a well-preserved condition and is now deposited
in the Louvre. It has twenty-one strings; a greater number
than is generally represented on the monuments. All these
instruments, however much they differed from each other in
form, had one peculiarity in common, namely the absence of
the fore pillar.</p>

<p>The <dfn>nefer</dfn>, a kind of guitar, was almost identical in construction
with the Tamboura at the present day in use among
several eastern nations. It was evidently a great favourite
with the ancient Egyptians, and occurs in representations
of concerts dating earlier than from <span class="sc">B.C.</span> 1500. The
<dfn>nefer</dfn> affords the best proof that the Egyptians had made
considerable progress in music at a very early age; since it
shows that they understood how to produce on a few strings, by
means of the finger-board, a greater number of notes than were
obtainable even on their harps. The instrument had two or
four strings, was played with a plectrum and appears to have
been sometimes, if not always, provided with frets. In the
British Museum is a fragment of a fresco obtained from a
tomb at Thebes, on which two female performers on the <dfn>nefer</dfn>
are represented. The painter has distinctly indicated the
frets.</p>

<p>Small pipes or flutes of the Egyptians have been discovered,
made of reed, with three, four, five, or more finger-holes. There
are some interesting examples in the British Museum; one of
which has seven holes burnt in at the side (<a href="#fig_3">Fig. 3</a>). Two
straws were found with it of nearly the same length as the
pipe, which is about one foot long. In some other pipes
pieces of a kind of thick straw have also been found inserted
into the tube, obviously serving for a similar purpose as the
<dfn>reed</dfn> in our oboe or clarionet.</p>

</div>
<!--Pg 028--><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pageno">13</span>

<p>The <dfn>sebȧ</dfn>, a single flute, was of considerable length, and the
performer appears to have been obliged to extend his arms
almost at full length in order to reach the furthest finger-hole.
As <dfn>sebȧ</dfn> is also the name of the leg-bone (like the Latin <dfn>tibia</dfn>) it
may be supposed that the Egyptian flute was originally made
of bone. Those, however, which have been found are of
wood or reed.</p>

<p>A flute-concert is painted on one of the tombs in the
pyramids of Gizeh and dates, according to Lepsius, from an
age earlier than <span class="sc">B.C.</span> 2000. Eight musicians are performing
on flutes. Three of them, one behind the other, are
kneeling and holding their flutes in exactly the same
manner. Facing these are three others, in a precisely
similar position. A seventh is sitting on the ground to
the left of the six, with his back turned towards them, but
also in the act of blowing his flute, like the others. An
eighth is standing at the right side of the group with his
face turned towards them, holding his flute before him with
both hands, as if he were going to put it to his mouth, or had
just left off playing. He is clothed, while the others have
only a narrow girdle round their loins. Perhaps he is the
director of this singular band, or the <em>solo</em> performer who is
waiting for the termination of the <dfn>tutti</dfn> before renewing his
part of the performance. The division of the players into
two sets, facing each other, suggests the possibility that the
instruments were classed somewhat like the first and second
violins, or the <dfn>flauto primo</dfn> and <dfn>flauto secondo</dfn> of our orchestras.
The occasional employment of the interval of the third, or
the fifth, as accompaniment to the melody, is not unusual
even with nations less advanced in music than were the
ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p>The Double-Pipe, called <dfn>mam</dfn>, appears to have been a
very popular instrument, if we judge from the frequency of
its occurrence in the representations of musical performances.
Furthermore, the Egyptians had, as far as is known to us,
<!--Pg 029--><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pageno">14</span>
two kinds of trumpets; three kinds of tambourines, or little
hand drums; three kinds of drums, chiefly barrel-shaped;
and various kinds of gongs, bells, cymbals, and castanets.
The trumpet appears to have been usually of brass. A
peculiar wind-instrument, somewhat the shape of a champagne
bottle and perhaps made of pottery or wood, also occurs
in the representations transmitted to us.</p>

<p>The Egyptian drum was from two to three feet in length,
covered with parchment at both ends and braced by cords.
The performer carried it before him, generally by means of a
band over his shoulder, while he was heating it with his hands
on both ends. Of another kind of drum an actual specimen
has been found in the excavations made in the year 1823 at
Thebes. It was 1½ feet high and 2 feet broad, and had cords
for bracing it. A piece of catgut encircled each end of the
drum, being wound round each cord, by means of which the
cords could be tightened or slackened at pleasure by pushing
the two hands of catgut towards or from each other. It was
beaten with two drumsticks slightly bent. The Egyptians
had also straight drumsticks with a handle, and a knob at the
end. The Berlin museum possesses some of these. The
third kind of drum was almost identical with the <dfn>darabuka</dfn>
of the modern Egyptians. The Tambourine was either
round, like that which is at the present time in use in
Europe as well as in the east; or it was of an oblong square
shape, slightly incurved on the four sides.</p>

<p>The Sistrum consisted of a frame of bronze into which three
or four metal bars were loosely inserted, so as to produce a
jingling noise when the instrument was shaken. (<a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4</a>.)
The bars were often made in the form of snakes, or they terminated
in the head of a goose. Not unfrequently a few
metal rings were strung on the bars, to increase the noise.
The frame was sometimes ornamented with the figure of a
cat. The largest sistra which have been found are about
eighteen inches in length, and the smallest about nine inches.
The sistrum was principally used by females in religious
performances. Its Egyptian name was <dfn>seshesh</dfn>.</p>

<p>The Egyptian cymbals closely resembled our own in shape.
There are several pairs of them in the British museum. One
pair was found in a coffin enclosing the mummy of a sacred
musician, and is deposited in the same case with the mummy
and coffin. Among the Egyptian antiquities in the British
museum are also several small bells of bronze (<a href="#fig_5">Fig. 5</a>). The
largest is 2¼ inches in height, and the smallest three-quarters
of an inch. Some of them have a hole at the side near the
top wherein the clapper was fastened.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">ASSYRIAN AND HEBREW.</h4>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The Assyrians.</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Our</span> acquaintance with the Assyrian instruments has
been derived almost entirely from the famous bas-reliefs
which have been excavated from the mounds of Nimroud,
Khorsabad, and Kouyunjik (the site of the ancient Nineveh),
situated near the river Tigris in the vicinity of the town of
Mosul in Asiatic Turkey.</p>

<p>The Assyrian harp was about four feet high, and appears
of larger size than it actually was on account of the ornamental
appendages which were affixed to the lower part of its
frame. It must have been but light in weight, since we find
it not unfrequently represented in the hands of persons who
are playing upon it while they are dancing. Like all the
Oriental harps, modern as well as ancient, it was not provided
with a front pillar. The upper portion of the frame
contained the sound-holes, somewhat in the shape of an hourglass.
Below them were the screws, or tuning-pegs, arranged
in regular order. The strings were perhaps made of silk, like
those which the Burmese use at the present time on their
harps; or they may have been of catgut, which was used
by the ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p>The largest assemblage of Assyrian musicians which has been
discovered on any monument consists of eleven performers
upon instruments, besides a chorus of singers. The first
musician&mdash;&#8203;probably the leader of the band, as he marches
alone at the head of the procession&mdash;&#8203;is playing upon a harp.
<!--Pg 034--><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pageno">17</span>
Behind him are two men; one with a dulcimer and the other
with a double-pipe; then follow two men with harps. Next
come six female musicians, four of whom are playing upon
harps, while one is blowing a double-pipe and another is
beating a small hand-drum covered only at the top. Close
behind the instrumental performers are the singers, consisting
of a chorus of females and children. They are clapping their
hands in time with the music, and some of the musicians are
dancing to the measure. One of the female singers is holding
her hand to her throat in the same manner as the women
in Syria, Arabia, and Persia are in the habit of doing at
the present day when producing, on festive occasions,
those peculiarly shrill sounds of rejoicing which have been
repeatedly noticed by travellers.</p>

<p>The dulcimer is in too imperfect a state on the bas-relief
to familiarize us with its construction. The slab representing
the procession in which it occurs has been injured; the defect
which extended over a portion of the dulcimer has been repaired,
and it cannot be said that in repairing it much musical
knowledge has been evinced.</p>

<p>The instrument of the Trigonon species was held horizontally,
and was twanged with a rather long plectrum slightly
bent at the end at which it was held by the performer. It
is of frequent occurrence on the bas-reliefs. A number of them
appear to have been generally played together. At any rate,
we find almost invariably on the monuments two together,
evidently implying “more than one,” “a number.” The
left hand of the performer seems to have been occupied in
checking the vibration of the strings when its discontinuance
was required. From the position of the strings the performer
could not have struck them as those of the dulcimer are struck.
If he did not twang them, he may have drawn the plectrum
across them. Indeed, for twanging, a short plectrum would
<!--Pg 035--><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pageno">18</span>
have been more practical, considering that the strings are
placed horizontally one above the other at regular distances.
It is therefore by no means improbable that we have here
a rude prototype of the violin bow.</p>

<p>The lyre occurs in three different forms, and is held horizontally
in playing, or at least nearly so. Its front bar was
generally either oblique or slightly curved. The strings were
tied round the bar so as to allow of their being pushed upwards
or downwards. In the former case the tension of the strings
increases, and the notes become therefore higher; on the
other hand, if the strings are pushed lower down the pitch
of the notes must become deeper. The lyre was played with
a small plectrum as well as with the fingers.</p>

<p>The Assyrian trumpet was very similar to the Egyptian.
Furthermore, we meet with three kinds of drums, of which
one is especially noteworthy on account of its odd shape,
somewhat resembling a sugar loaf; with the tambourine;
with two kinds of cymbals; and with bells, of which a considerable
number have been found in the mound of Nimroud.
These bells, which have greatly withstood the devastation
of time, are but small in size, the largest of them being only
3¼ inches in height and 2½ inches in diameter. Most of them
have a hole at the top, in which probably the clapper was
fastened. They are made of copper mixed with 14 per cent.
of tin.</p>

<p>Instrumental music was used by the Assyrians and Babylonians
in their religious observances. This is obvious from
the sculptures, and is to some extent confirmed by the mode
of worship paid by command of king Nebuchadnezzar to
the golden image; “Then an herald cried aloud, To you it
is commanded, O people, nations, and languages, that at what
time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut,
psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and
<!--Pg 036--><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pageno">19</span>
worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has
set up.” The kings appear to have maintained at their courts
musical bands, whose office it was to perform secular music
at certain times of the day or on fixed occasions. Of king
Darius we are told that, when he had cast Daniel into the
den of lions, he “went to his palace, and passed the night
fasting, neither were instruments of musick brought before
him;” from which we may conclude that his band was in
the habit of playing before him in the evening. A similar
custom prevailed also at the court of Jerusalem, at least in
the time of David and Solomon; both of whom appear to have
had their royal private bands, besides a large number of
singers and instrumental performers of sacred music who
were engaged in the Temple.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The Hebrews.</span></p>

<p>As regards the musical instruments of the Hebrews, we
are from biblical records acquainted with the names of many
of them; but representations to be trusted are still wanting,
and it is chiefly from an examination of the ancient Egyptian
and Assyrian instruments that we can conjecture almost to a
certainty their construction and capabilities. From various
indications, which it would be too circumstantial here to
point out, we believe the Hebrews to have possessed the
following instruments:</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Harp.</span>&mdash;There can be no doubt that the Hebrews
possessed the harp, seeing that it was a common instrument
among the Egyptians and Assyrians. But it is uncertain
which of the Hebrew names of the stringed instruments occurring
in the Bible really designates the harp.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Dulcimer.</span>&mdash;Some writers on Hebrew music consider
the <dfn>nevel</dfn> to have been a kind of dulcimer; others conjecture
<!--Pg 037--><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pageno">20</span>
the same of the <dfn>psanterin</dfn> mentioned in the hook of Daniel,&mdash;&#8203;a
name which appears to be synonymous with the <dfn>psalterion</dfn>
of the Greeks, and from which also the present oriental dulcimer,
<dfn>santir</dfn>, may have been derived. Some of the instruments
mentioned in the book of Daniel may have been
synonymous with some which occur in other parts of the
Bible under Hebrew names; the names given in Daniel being
Chaldæan. The <dfn>asor</dfn> was a ten-stringed instrument played
with a plectrum, and is supposed to have borne some resemblance
to the <dfn>nevel</dfn>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Lyre.</span>&mdash;This instrument is represented on some
Hebrew coins generally ascribed to Judas Maccabæus, who
lived in the second century before the Christian era. There
are several of them in the British Museum; some are of
silver, and the others of copper. On three of them are lyres
with three strings, another has one with five, and another
one with six strings. The two sides of the frame appear to
have been made of the horns of animals, or they may
have been of wood formed in imitation of two horns which
originally were used. Lyres thus constructed are still found in
Abyssinia. The Hebrew square-shaped lyre of the time of
Simon Maccabæus is probably identical with the <dfn>psalterion</dfn>.
The <dfn>kinnor</dfn>, the favourite instrument of king David, was most
likely a lyre if not a small triangular harp. The lyre was
evidently an universally known and favoured instrument
among ancient eastern nations. Being more simple in
construction than most other stringed instruments it undoubtedly
preceded them in antiquity. The <dfn>kinnor</dfn> is mentioned
in the Bible as the oldest stringed instrument, and
as the invention of Jubal. Even if the name of one particular
stringed instrument is here used for stringed instruments
in general, which may possibly be the case, it is only reasonable
to suppose that the oldest and most universally known
<!--Pg 038--><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pageno">21</span>
stringed instrument would be mentioned as a representative
of the whole class rather than any other. Besides, the
<dfn>kinnor</dfn> was a light and easily portable instrument; king
David, according to the Rabbinic records, used to suspend
it during the night over his pillow. All its uses mentioned
in the Bible are especially applicable to the lyre. And the
resemblance of the word <dfn>kinnor</dfn> to <dfn>kithara</dfn>, <dfn>kissar</dfn>, and similar
names known to denote the lyre, also tends to confirm the
supposition that it refers to this instrument. It is, however,
not likely that the instruments of the Hebrews&mdash;&#8203;indeed
their music altogether&mdash;&#8203;should have remained entirely
unchanged during a period of many centuries. Some modifications
were likely to occur even from accidental causes;
such, for instance, as the influence of neighbouring nations
when the Hebrews came into closer contact with them.
Thus may be explained why the accounts of the Hebrew
instruments given by Josephus, who lived in the first century
of the Christian era, are not in exact accordance with those
in the Bible. The lyres at the time of Simon Maccabæus
may probably be different from those which were in use about
a thousand years earlier, or at the time of David and Solomon,
when the art of music with the Hebrews was at its zenith.</p>

<p>There appears to be a probability that a Hebrew lyre
of the time of Joseph (about 1700 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>) is represented on an
ancient Egyptian painting<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span>
 discovered in a tomb at Beni
Hassan&mdash;&#8203;which is the name of certain grottoes on the eastern
bank of the Nile. Sir Gardner Wilkinson, in his “Manners
and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians,” observes: “If,
when we become better acquainted with the interpretation
of hieroglyphics, the ‘strangers’ at Beni Hassan should prove
to be the arrival of Jacob’s family in Egypt, we may examine
<!--Pg 039--><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pageno">22</span>
the Jewish lyre drawn by an Egyptian artist. That this
event took place about the period when the inmate of the
tomb lived is highly probable&mdash;&#8203;at least, if I am correct in considering
Usertsen I. to be the Pharaoh who was the patron of
Joseph; and it remains for us to decide whether the disagreement
in the number of persons here introduced, thirty-seven
being written over them in hieroglyphics, is a sufficient
objection to their identity. It will not be foreign to the
present subject to introduce those figures, which are curious,
if only considered as illustrative of ancient customs at that
early period, and which will be looked upon with unbounded
interest should they ever be found to refer to the Jews.
The first figure is an Egyptian scribe, who presents an account
of their arrival to a person seated, the owner of the tomb,
and one of the principal officers of the reigning Pharaoh.
The next, also an Egyptian, ushers them into his presence;
and two advance bringing presents, the wild goat or ibex
and the gazelle, the productions of their country. Four men,
carrying bows and clubs, follow, leading an ass on which
two children are placed in panniers, accompanied by a boy
and four women; and, last of all, another ass laden, and
two men&mdash;&#8203;one holding a bow and club, the other a lyre, which
he plays with the plectrum. All the men have beards, contrary
to the custom of the Egyptians, but very general in the East
at that period, and noticed as a peculiarity of foreign uncivilized
nations throughout their sculptures. The men have
sandals, the women a sort of boot reaching to the ankle,
both which were worn by many Asiatic people. The lyre
is rude, and differs in form from those generally used in
Egypt.” In the engraving the lyre-player, another man,
and some strange animals from this group, are represented.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Tamboura.</span>&mdash;<dfn>Minnim</dfn>, <dfn>machalath</dfn>, and <dfn>nevel</dfn> are
usually supposed to be the names of instruments of the lute
<!--Pg 040--><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pageno">23</span>
or guitar kind. <dfn>Minnim</dfn>, however, appears more likely to
imply stringed instruments in general than any particular
instrument.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Single Pipe.</span>&mdash;<dfn>Chalil</dfn> and <dfn>nekeb</dfn> were the names of the
Hebrew pipes or flutes.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Double Pipe.</span>&mdash;Probably the <dfn>mishrokitha</dfn> mentioned
in Daniel. The <dfn>mishrokitha</dfn> is represented in the drawings of
our histories of music as a small organ, consisting of seven
pipes placed in a box with a mouthpiece for blowing. But
the shape of the pipes and of the box as well as the row of
keys for the fingers exhibited in the representation of the
<dfn>mishrokitha</dfn> have too much of the European type not to
suggest that they are probably a product of the imagination.
Respecting the illustrations of Hebrew instruments which
usually accompany historical treatises on music and commentaries
on the Bible, it ought to be borne in mind that most
of them are merely the offspring of conjectures founded on
some obscure hints in the Bible, or vague accounts by the
Rabbins.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Syrinx or Pandean Pipe.</span>&mdash;Probably the <dfn>ugab</dfn>,
which in the English authorised version of the Bible is rendered
“organ."</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Bagpipe.</span>&mdash;The word <dfn>sumphonia</dfn>, which occurs in the
book of Daniel, is, by Forkel and others, supposed to denote
a bagpipe. It is remarkable that at the present day the
bagpipe is called by the Italian peasantry Zampogna.
Another Hebrew instrument, the <dfn>magrepha</dfn>, generally described
as an organ, was more likely only a kind of bagpipe.
The <dfn>magrepha</dfn> is not mentioned in the Bible but is described
in the Talmud. In tract Erachin it is recorded to have been
a powerful organ which stood in the temple at Jerusalem,
and consisted of a case or wind-chest, with ten holes, containing
ten pipes. Each pipe was capable of emitting ten
<!--Pg 041--><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pageno">24</span>
different sounds, by means of finger-holes or some similar
contrivance: thus one hundred different sounds could be
produced on this instrument. Further, the <dfn>magrepha</dfn> is
said to have been provided with two pairs of bellows and
with ten keys, by means of which it was played with the
fingers. Its tone was, according to the Rabbinic accounts,
so loud that it could be heard at an incredibly long distance
from the temple. Authorities so widely differ that we must
leave it uncertain whether the much-lauded <dfn>magrepha</dfn> was
a bagpipe, an organ, or a kettle-drum.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Trumpet.</span>&mdash;Three kinds are mentioned in the Bible,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, the <dfn>keren</dfn>, the <dfn>shophar</dfn>, and the <dfn>chatzozerah</dfn>. The first
two were more or less curved and might properly be considered
as horns. Most commentators are of opinion that
the <dfn>keren</dfn>&mdash;&#8203;made of ram’s horn&mdash;&#8203;was almost identical with
the <dfn>shophar</dfn>, the only difference being that the latter was
more curved than the former. The <dfn>shophar</dfn> is especially
remarkable as being the only Hebrew musical instrument
which has been preserved to the present day in the religious
services of the Jews. It is still blown in the synagogue, as
in time of old, at the Jewish new-year’s festival, according
to the command of Moses (<abbr title="Number twenty-nine">Numb. xxix.</abbr> 1). The <dfn>chatzozerah</dfn>
was a straight trumpet, about two feet in length, and was
sometimes made of silver. Two of these straight trumpets
are shown in the famous triumphal procession after the fall
of Jerusalem on the arch of Titus.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Drum.</span>&mdash;There can be no doubt that the Hebrews
had several kinds of drums. We know, however, only of
the <dfn>toph</dfn>, which appears to have been a tambourine or a small
hand-drum like the Egyptian darabuka. In the English
version of the Bible the word is rendered <dfn>timbrel</dfn> or <dfn>tabret</dfn>.
This instrument was especially used in processions on occasions
of rejoicing, and also frequently by females. We find
<!--Pg 042--><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pageno">25</span>
it in the hands of Miriam, when she was celebrating with
the Israelitish women in songs of joy the destruction of
Pharaoh’s host; and in the hands of Jephtha’s daughter,
when she went out to welcome her father. There exists at
the present day in the East a small hand-drum called <dfn>doff</dfn>,
<dfn>diff</dfn>, or <dfn>adufe</dfn>&mdash;&#8203;a name which appears to be synonymous
with the Hebrew <dfn>toph</dfn>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Sistrum.</span>&mdash;Winer, Saalschütz, and several other commentators
are of opinion that the <dfn>menaaneim</dfn>, mentioned in
2 <abbr title="Samuel six">Sam. vi.</abbr> 5, denotes the sistrum. In the English Bible
the original is translated <dfn>cymbals</dfn>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Cymbals.</span>&mdash;The <dfn>tzeltzelim</dfn>, <dfn>metzilloth</dfn>, and <dfn>metzilthaim</dfn>,
appear to have been cymbals or similar metallic instruments
of percussion, differing in shape and sound.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bells.</span>&mdash;The little bells on the vestments of the high-priest
were called <dfn>phaamon</dfn>. Small golden bells were attached
to the lower part of the robes of the high-priest in
his sacred ministrations. The Jews have, at the present
day, in their synagogues small bells fastened to the rolls of
the Law containing the Pentateuch: a kind of ornamentation
which is supposed to have been in use from time
immemorial.</p>

<p>Besides the names of Hebrew instruments already given
there occur several others in the Old Testament, upon the
real meaning of which much diversity of opinion prevails.
<dfn>Jobel</dfn> is by some commentators classed with the trumpets,
but it is by others believed to designate a loud and cheerful
blast of the trumpet, used on particular occasions. If <dfn>Jobel</dfn>
(from which <dfn>jubilare</dfn> is supposed to be derived) is identical
with the name <dfn>Jubal</dfn>, the inventor of musical instruments,
it would appear that the Hebrews appreciated pre-eminently
the exhilarating power of music. <dfn>Shalisbim</dfn> is supposed to
denote a triangle. <dfn>Nechiloth</dfn>, <dfn>gittith</dfn>, and <dfn>machalath</dfn>, which
<!--Pg 043--><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pageno">26</span>
occur in the headings of some psalms, are also by commentators
supposed to be musical instruments. <dfn>Nechiloth</dfn> is
said to have been a flute, and <dfn>gittith</dfn> and <dfn>machalath</dfn> to have
been stringed instruments, and <dfn>machol</dfn> a kind of flute. Again,
others maintain that the words denote peculiar modes of
performance or certain favourite melodies to which the psalms
were directed to be sung, or chanted. According to the
records of the Rabbins, the Hebrews in the time of David
and Solomon possessed thirty-six different musical instruments.
In the Bible only about half that number are
mentioned.</p>

<p>Most nations of antiquity ascribed the invention of their
musical instruments to their gods, or to certain superhuman
beings. The Hebrews attributed it to man; Jubal is mentioned
in Genesis as “the father of all such as handle the harp
and organ” (<span class="decoration">i.e.</span>, performers on stringed instruments and
wind instruments). As instruments of percussion are almost
invariably in use long before people are led to construct
stringed and wind instruments it might perhaps be surmised
that Jubal was not regarded as the inventor of all the
Hebrew instruments, but rather as the first professional
cultivator of instrumental music.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">GREEK, ETRUSCAN AND ROMAN.</h4>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The Greeks.</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Many</span> musical instruments of the ancient Greeks are known
to us by name; but respecting their exact construction and
capabilities there still prevails almost as much diversity of
opinion as is the case with those of the Hebrews.</p>

<p>It is generally believed that the Greeks derived their musical
system from the Egyptians. Pythagoras and other philosophers
are said to have studied music in Egypt. It would,
however, appear that the Egyptian influence upon Greece, as
far as regards this art, has been overrated. Not only have the
more perfect Egyptian instruments&mdash;&#8203;such as the larger harps,
the tamboura&mdash;&#8203;never been much in favour with the Greeks,
but almost all the stringed instruments which the Greeks
possessed are stated to have been originally derived from
Asia. Strabo says: “Those who regard the whole of Asia, as
far as India, as consecrated to Bacchus, point to that country
as the origin of a great portion of the present music. One
author speaks of ‘striking forcibly the Asiatic kithara,’
another calls the pipes Berecynthian and Phrygian. Some
of the instruments also have foreign names, as Nablas,
Sambyke, Barbitos, Magadis, and many others."</p>

<p>We know at present little more of these instruments than
that they were in use in Greece. The Magadis is described as
having twenty strings. The other three are known to have
been stringed instruments. But they cannot have been anything
like such universal favourites as the lyre, because this
<!--Pg 045--><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pageno">28</span>
instrument and perhaps the <dfn>trigonon</dfn> are almost the only
stringed instruments represented in the Greek paintings on
pottery and other monumental records. If, as might perhaps
be suggested, their taste for beauty of form induced the
Greeks to represent the elegant lyre in preference to other
stringed instruments, we might at least expect to meet with
the harp; an instrument which equals if it does not surpass
the lyre in elegance of form.</p>

<p>The representation of a Muse with a harp, depicted on
a splendid Greek vase now in the Munich Museum (<cite>Mun.
Vase <abbr title="Catalogue Number">Cat. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr></abbr> 805</cite>), may be noted as an exceptional instance.
This valuable relic dates from the end of the fifth century
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> The instrument resembles in construction as well as
in shape the Assyrian harp, and has fifteen strings. The
Muse is touching them with both hands, using the right hand
for the treble and the left for the bass. She is seated,
holding the instrument in her lap. The little tuning-pegs,
which in number are not in accordance with the strings, are
placed on the sound-board at the upper part of the frame,
exactly as on the Assyrian harp. If we have here the Greek
harp, it was more likely an importation from Asia than from
Egypt. In short, as far as can be ascertained, the most
complete of the Greek instruments appear to be of Asiatic
origin. Especially from the nations who inhabited Asia
Minor the Greeks are stated to have adopted several of
the most popular. Thus we may read of the short and
shrill-sounding pipes of the Carians; of the Phrygian pastoral
flute; of the three-stringed <dfn>kithara</dfn> of the Lydians; and so on.</p>

<p>The Greeks had lyres of various kinds, more or less differing
in construction, form, and size, and distinguished by different
names; such as <dfn>lyra</dfn>, <dfn>kithara</dfn>, <dfn>chelys</dfn>, <dfn>phorminx</dfn>, etc. <dfn>Lyra</dfn>
appears to have implied instruments of this class in general,
and also the lyre with a body oval at the base and held in
<!--Pg 046--><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pageno">29</span>
the arms of the performer; while the <dfn>kithara</dfn> had a square
base and was held against the side by a sash around it. The
<dfn>chelys</dfn> was a small lyre with the body made of the shell of a
tortoise, or of wood in imitation of the tortoise. The <dfn>phorminx</dfn>
was a large lyre, and, like the <dfn>kithara</dfn>, was used at
an early period singly, for accompanying recitations. It is
recorded that the <dfn>kithara</dfn> was employed for solo performances
as early as <span class="sc">B.C.</span> 700.</p>

  From a Greek vase in the Munich Museum.</p>
</div>

<p>The design on the Greek vase at Munich (already alluded
to) represents the nine Muses, of whom three are given in the
engraving (<a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6</a>), <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, one with the harp, and two others
with lyres. Some of the lyres were provided with a bridge,
while others were without it. The largest was held probably
on or between the knees, or were attached to the left arm by
means of a band, to enable the performer to use his hands
<!--Pg 047--><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pageno">30</span>
without impediment. The strings, made of catgut or sinew,
were more usually twanged with a <dfn>plektron</dfn> than merely with
the fingers. The <dfn>plektron</dfn> was a short stem of ivory or metal
pointed at both ends.</p>

<p>A fragment of a Greek lyre which was found in a tomb near
Athens is deposited in the British Museum. The two pieces
constituting its frame are of wood. Their length is about
18 inches, and the length of the cross-bar at the top is
about 9 inches. The instrument is unhappily in a condition
too dilapidated and imperfect to be of any essential use to
the musical inquirer.</p>

<p>The <dfn>trigonon</dfn> consisted originally of an angular frame, to
which the strings were affixed. In the course of time a third
bar was added to resist the tension of the strings, and its triangular
frame resembled in shape the Greek delta. Subsequently
it was still further improved, the upper bar of the
frame being made slightly curved, whereby the instrument
obtained greater strength and more elegance of form.</p>

<p>The <dfn>magadis</dfn>, also called <dfn>pektis</dfn>, had twenty strings which
were tuned in octaves, and therefore produced only ten tones.
It appears to have been some sort of dulcimer, but information
respecting its construction is still wanting. There appears to
have been also a kind of bagpipe in use called <dfn>magadis</dfn>, of which
nothing certain is known. Possibly, the same name may have
been applied to two different instruments.</p>

<!--Pg 050--><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pageno">31</span>

<p>The <dfn>barbitos</dfn> was likewise a stringed instrument of this kind.
The <dfn>sambyke</dfn> is traditionally said to have been invented by
Ibykos, about 560 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> The <dfn>simikon</dfn> had thirty-five strings,
and derived its name from its inventor, Simos, who lived about
600 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> It was perhaps a kind of dulcimer. The <dfn>nabla</dfn> had
ten, or according to Josephus, twelve strings, and probably
resembled the <dfn>nevel</dfn> of the Hebrews, of which but little is
known with certainty. The <dfn>pandoura</dfn> is supposed to have
been a kind of lute with three strings. Several of the
instruments just noticed were used in Greece, chiefly by
musicians who had immigrated from Asia; they can therefore
hardly be considered as national musical instruments
of the Greeks. The <dfn>monochord</dfn> had (as its name implies) only a
single string, and was used as a tuning string.</p>

<p>The <dfn>aulos</dfn>, of which there were many varieties, was a highly
popular instrument, and differed in construction from the
flutes and pipes of the ancient Egyptians. Instead of being
blown through a hole at the side near the top it was held
like a flageolet, and a vibrating reed was inserted into the
mouth-piece, so that it might be more properly described as
a kind of oboe or clarinet. The Greeks were accustomed to
designate by the name of <dfn>aulos</dfn> all wind instruments of the
flute and oboe kind, some of which were constructed like
the flageolet or like our antiquated
<dfn>flûte à bec</dfn>. The single
flute was called <dfn>monaulos</dfn> (Fig.
7), and the double one <dfn>diaulos</dfn>
(<a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a>). A <dfn>diaulos</dfn>, which was
found in a tomb at Athens,
is in the British Museum. The
wood of which it is made
seems to be cedar, and the tubes
are fifteen inches in length.
Each tube has a separate
mouth-piece and six finger-holes,
five of which are at the
upper side and one is underneath.</p>

<p>The <dfn>syrinx</dfn>, or Pandean pipe,
had from three to nine tubes,
but seven was the usual
<!--Pg 051--><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pageno">32</span>
number. The straight trumpet, <dfn>salpinx</dfn>, and the curved horn,
<dfn>keras</dfn>, made of brass, were used exclusively in war. The
small hand-drum, called <dfn>tympanon</dfn>, resembled in shape our
tambourine, and was covered with parchment at the back
as well as at the front. The <dfn>kymbala</dfn> were made of metal,
and resembled our small cymbals. The <dfn>krotala</dfn> were almost
identical with our castanets, and were made of wood or
metal.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The Etruscans and Romans.</span></p>

<p>The Romans are recorded to have derived some of their most
popular instruments originally from the Etruscans, a people
which at an early period excelled all other Italian nations in the
cultivation of the arts as well as in social refinement, and which
possessed musical instruments similar to those of the Greeks.
It must, however, be remembered that many of the vases
and other specimens of art which have been found in Etruscan
tombs, and on which delineations of lyres and other instruments
occur, are supposed to be productions of Greek artists
whose works were obtained from Greece by the Etruscans,
or who were induced to settle in Etruria.</p>

<p>The flutes of the Etruscans were not unfrequently made of
ivory; those used in religious sacrifices were of box-wood, of a
species of the lotus, of ass’ bone, bronze and silver. A bronze
flute, somewhat resembling our flageolet, has been found in a
tomb; likewise a huge trumpet of bronze. An Etruscan <dfn>cornu</dfn>
is deposited in the British Museum, and measures about four
feet in length.</p>

<p>To the Etruscans is also attributed by some the invention
of the hydraulic organ. The Greeks possessed a somewhat
similar contrivance which they called <dfn>hydraulis</dfn>, <span class="decoration">i.e.</span>, water-flute
and which probably was identical with the <dfn>organum</dfn>
<!--Pg 052--><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pageno">33</span>
<dfn>hydraulicum</dfn> of the Romans. The instrument ought more
properly to be regarded as a pneumatic organ, for the sound
was produced by the current of air through the pipes; the
water applied serving merely to give the necessary pressure to
the bellows and to regulate their action. The pipes were
probably caused to sound by means of stops, perhaps resembling
those on our organ, which were drawn out or pushed in.
The construction was evidently but a primitive contrivance,
contained in a case which could be carried by one or two
persons and which was placed on a table. The highest degree
of perfection which the hydraulic organ obtained with the
ancients is perhaps shown in a representation on a coin of the
Emperor Nero, in the British Museum. Only ten pipes are
given to it, and there is no indication of any keyboard, which
would probably have been shown had it existed. The man
standing at the side and holding a laurel leaf in his hand is
surmised to represent a victor in the exhibitions of the circus
or the amphitheatre. The hydraulic organ probably was
played on such occasions; and the medal containing an
impression of it may have been bestowed upon the victor.</p>

<p>During the time of the Republic, and especially subsequently
under the reign of the Emperors, the Romans adopted
many new instruments from Greece, Egypt, and even from
western Asia; without essentially improving any of their
importations.</p>

<p>Their most favourite stringed instrument was the lyre, of
which they had various kinds, called, according to their form
and arrangement of strings, <dfn>lyra</dfn>, <dfn>cithara</dfn>, <dfn>chelys</dfn>, <dfn>testudo</dfn>, and
<dfn>fidis</dfn> (or <dfn>fides</dfn>). The name <dfn>cornu</dfn> was given to the lyre when
the sides of the frame terminated at the top in the shape
of two horns. The <dfn>barbitos</dfn> was a kind of lyre with a large
body, which gave the instrument somewhat the shape of the
Welsh <dfn>crwth</dfn>. The <dfn>psalterium</dfn> was a kind of lyre of an oblong
<!--Pg 053--><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pageno">34</span>
square shape. Like most of the Roman lyres, it was played
with a rather large plectrum. The <dfn>trigonum</dfn> was the same as
the Greek <dfn>trigonon</dfn>. It is recorded that a certain musician of
the name of Alexander Alexandrinus was so admirable a performer
upon it that when exhibiting his skill in Rome he
created the greatest <dfn>furore</dfn>. Less common, and derived from
Asia, were the <dfn>sambuca</dfn> and <dfn>nablia</dfn>, the exact construction
of which is unknown.</p>

<p>The flute, <dfn>tibia</dfn>, was originally made of the shin bone, and
had a mouth-hole and four finger-holes. Its shape was
retained even when, at a later period, it was constructed of
other substances than bone. The <dfn>tibia gingrina</dfn> consisted
of a long and thin tube of reed with a mouth-hole at the side
of one end. The <dfn>tibia obliqua</dfn> and <dfn>tibia vasca</dfn> were provided
with mouth-pieces affixed at a right angle to the tube; a
contrivance somewhat similar to that on our bassoon. The
<dfn>tibia longa</dfn> was especially used in religious worship. The
<dfn>tibia curva</dfn> was curved at its broadest end. The <dfn>tibia ligula</dfn>
appears to have resembled our flageolet. The <dfn>calamus</dfn> was
nothing more than a simple pipe cut off the kind of reed which
the ancients used as a pen for writing.</p>

<p>The Romans had double flutes as well as single flutes. The
double flute consisted of two tubes united, either so as to have
a mouth-piece in common or to have each a separate mouth-piece.
If the tubes were exactly alike the double flute was
called <dfn>tibiæ pares</dfn>; if they were different from each other,
<dfn>tibiæ impares</dfn>. Little plugs, or stoppers, were inserted into
the finger-holes to regulate the order of intervals. The <dfn>tibia</dfn>
was made in various shapes. The <dfn>tibia dextra</dfn> was usually
constructed of the upper and thinner part of a reed; and the
<dfn>tibia sinistra</dfn>, of the lower and broader part. The performers
used also the <dfn>capistrum</dfn>,&mdash;&#8203;a bandage round the cheeks identical
with the <dfn>phorbeia</dfn> of the Greeks.</p>

<p>The British Museum contains a wall painting (<a href="#fig_9">Fig. 9</a>) representing
a Roman youth playing the double pipes, which is
stated to have been disinterred in the year 1823 on the Via
Appia. Here the <dfn>holmos</dfn> or mouth-piece, somewhat resembling
the reed of our oboe, is distinctly shown. The finger-holes,
probably four, are not indicated, although they undoubtedly
existed on the instrument.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Romans had two kinds of Pandean pipes
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, the <dfn>syrinx</dfn> and the <dfn>fistula</dfn>. The bagpipe, <dfn>tibia utricularis</dfn>,
is said to have been a favourite instrument of the Emperor
Nero.</p>

<p>The <dfn>cornu</dfn> was a large horn of bronze, curved. The performer
held it under his arm with the broad end upwards
over his shoulder. It is represented in the engraving (<a href="#fig_10">Fig.
10</a>), with the <dfn>tuba</dfn>
and the <dfn>lituus</dfn>.</p>

 <p class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 10.&mdash;Tuba Cornu</span> and <span class="sc">Lituus</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>The <dfn>tuba</dfn> was a
straight trumpet.
Both the <dfn>cornu</dfn> and
the <dfn>tuba</dfn> were employed
in war to convey
signals. The
same was the case
with the <dfn>buccina</dfn>,&mdash;&#8203;originally
perhaps a
conch shell, and
afterwards a simple
horn of an animal,&mdash;&#8203;and
the <dfn>lituus</dfn>,
which was bent at the broad end but otherwise straight. The
<dfn>tympanum</dfn> resembled the tambourine, and was beaten like
the latter with the hands. Among the Roman instruments of
percussion the <dfn>scabellum</dfn>, which consisted of two plates combined
<!--Pg 057--><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pageno">36</span>
by means of a sort of hinge, deserves to be noticed;
it was fastened under the foot and trodden in time, to produce
certain rhythmical effects in musical performances. The
<dfn>cymbalum</dfn> consisted of two metal plates similar to our
cymbals. The <dfn>crotala</dfn> and the <dfn>crusmata</dfn> were kinds of castanets,
the former being oblong and of a larger size than the
latter. The Romans had also a <dfn>triangulum</dfn>, which resembled
the triangle occasionally used in our orchestra. The <dfn>sistrum</dfn>
they derived from Egypt with the introduction of the worship
of Isis. Metal bells, arranged according to a regular order
of intervals and placed in a frame, were called <dfn>tintinnabula</dfn>.
The <dfn>crepitaculum</dfn> appears to have been a somewhat similar
contrivance on a hoop with a handle.</p>

<p>Through the Greeks and Romans we have the first well-authenticated
proof of musical instruments having been
introduced into Europe from Asia. The Romans in their
conquests undoubtedly made their musical instruments
known, to some extent, also in western Europe. But the
Greeks and Romans are not the only nations which introduced
Eastern instruments into Europe. The Phœnicians at
an early period colonized Sardinia, and traces of them are
still to be found on that island. Among these is a peculiarly
constructed double-pipe, called <dfn>lionedda</dfn> or <dfn>launedda</dfn>. Again,
at a much later period the Arabs introduced several of their
instruments into Spain, from which country they became
known in France, Germany, and England. Also the
crusaders, during the eleventh and twelfth centuries, may have
helped to familiarize the western European nations with
instruments of the East.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The Chinese.</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Allowing</span> for any exaggeration as to chronology, natural
to the lively imagination of Asiatics, there is no reason to
doubt that the Chinese possessed long before our Christian
era musical instruments to which they attribute a fabulously
high antiquity. There is an ancient tradition, according
to which they obtained their musical scale from a miraculous
bird, called <dfn>fêng-huang</dfn>, which appears to have been a sort of
phœnix. When Confucius, who lived about <span class="sc">B.C.</span> 551-479,
happened to hear on a certain occasion some Chinese music,
he is said to have become so greatly enraptured that he could
not take any food for three months afterwards. The sounds
which produced this effect were those of K’uei, the Orpheus
of the Chinese, whose performance on the <dfn>ch’ing</dfn>&mdash;&#8203;a kind of
harmonicon constructed of slabs of sonorous stone&mdash;&#8203;would
draw wild animals around him and make them subservient
to his will. As regards the invention of musical instruments
the Chinese have other traditions. In one of these we are
told that the origin of some of their most popular instruments
dates from the period when China was under the dominion
of heavenly spirits, called Ch’i. Another assigns the invention
of several stringed instruments to the great Fu-hsi who
was the founder of the empire and who lived about <span class="sc">B.C.</span> 3000,
which was long after the dominion of the Ch’i, or spirits.
Again, another tradition holds that the most important
instruments and systematic arrangements of sounds are an
invention of Nü-wa, sister and successor of Fu-hsi.</p>

<p><!--Pg 059--><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pageno">38</span>
According to their records, the Chinese possessed their
much-esteemed <dfn>ch’ing</dfn> 2200 years before our Christian era, and
employed it for accompanying songs of praise. It was regarded
as a sacred instrument. During religious observances
at the solemn moment when the <dfn>ch’ing</dfn> was sounded sticks of
incense were burnt. It was likewise played before the emperor
early in the morning when he awoke. The Chinese
have long since constructed various kinds of the <dfn>ch’ing</dfn>,
by using different species of stones. Their most famous
stone selected for this purpose is called <dfn>yü</dfn>. <dfn>Yü</dfn> includes
the two varieties of jade, nephrite and jadeite. It is not
only very sonorous but also beautiful in appearance. It
is found in mountain streams and crevices of rocks.
The largest known specimens measure from two to three
feet in diameter, but examples of this size rarely occur. The
<dfn>yü</dfn> is very hard and heavy. Some European mineralogists,
to whom the missionaries transmitted specimens for examination,
pronounce it to be a species of agate (<dfn>ma-nao</dfn>).
It is found of different colours, and the Chinese appear to
have preferred in different centuries particular colours for
the <dfn>ch’ing</dfn>.</p>

<p>The Chinese consider the <dfn>yü</dfn> especially valuable for musical
purposes, because it always retains exactly the same pitch.
All other musical instruments, they say, are in this respect
doubtful; but the tone of the <dfn>yü</dfn> is influenced neither by
cold nor heat, nor by humidity, nor dryness.</p>

<p>The stones used for the <dfn>ch’ing</dfn> have been cut from time to
time in various grotesque shapes. Some represent animals:
as, for instance, a bat with outstretched wings; or two
fishes placed side by side: others are in the shape of an
ancient Chinese bell. The angular shape appears to be the
oldest form and is still retained in the ornamental stones of
the <dfn>pien-ch’ing</dfn>, which is a more modern instrument than the
<!--Pg 060--><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pageno">39</span>
<dfn>ch’ing</dfn>. The tones of the <dfn>pien-ch’ing</dfn> are attuned according
to the Chinese intervals called <dfn>lü</dfn>, of which there are twelve
in the compass of an octave. The same is the case with
the other Chinese instruments of this class. They vary,
however, in pitch. The pitch of the <dfn>sung-ch’ing</dfn>, for instance,
is four intervals lower than that of the <dfn>pien-ch’ing</dfn>.</p>

<p>Sonorous stones have always been used by the Chinese
also singly, as rhythmical instruments. Such a single stone is
called <dfn>t’ê-ch’ing</dfn>.</p>

<p>The ancient Chinese had several kinds of bells, frequently
arranged in sets so as to constitute a musical scale. The
Chinese name for the bell is <dfn>chung</dfn>. At an early period they
had a somewhat square-shaped bell called <dfn>t’ê-chung</dfn>. Like
other ancient Chinese bells it was made of copper alloyed with
tin, the proportion being one part of tin to six of copper.
The <dfn>t’ê-chung</dfn>, which is also known by the name of <dfn>piao</dfn>, was
principally used to indicate the time and divisions in musical
performances. It had a fixed pitch of sound, and several of
these bells attuned to a certain order of intervals were not
unfrequently ranged in a regular succession, thus forming a
musical instrument which was called <dfn>pien-chung</dfn>. The
musical scale of the sixteen bells which the <dfn>pien-chung</dfn> contained
was the same as that of the <dfn>ch’ing</dfn> before mentioned.</p>

<p>The <dfn>hsüan-chung</dfn> was, according to popular tradition,
included with the antique instruments at the time of Confucius,
and came into popular use during the Han dynasty
(from <span class="sc">B.C.</span> 200 until <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 200). It was of a peculiar oval
shape and had nearly the same quaint ornamentation as the
<dfn>t’ê-chung</dfn>; this consisted of symbolical figures, in four divisions,
each containing nine mammals. The mouth was
crescent-shaped. Every figure had a deep meaning referring
to the seasons and to the mysteries of the Buddhist religion.
The largest <dfn>hsüan-chung</dfn> was about twenty inches in length;
<!--Pg 061--><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pageno">40</span>
and, like the <dfn>t’ê-chung</dfn>, was sounded by means of a small
wooden mallet with an oval knob. None of the bells of this
description had a clapper. It would, however, appear that
the Chinese had at an early period some kind of bell provided
with a wooden tongue: this was used for military purposes
as well as for calling the people together when an imperial
messenger promulgated his sovereign’s commands. An
expression of Confucius is recorded to the effect that he
wished to be “A wooden-tongued bell of Heaven,” <span class="decoration">i.e.</span>, a
herald of heaven to proclaim the divine purposes to the
multitude.</p>

<p>The <dfn>fang-hsiang</dfn> was a kind of wood-harmonicon. It contained
sixteen wooden slabs of an oblong square shape, suspended
in a wooden frame elegantly decorated. The slabs
were arranged in two tiers, one above the other, and were all
of equal length and breadth but differed in thickness. The
<dfn>ch’un-tu</dfn> consisted of twelve slips of bamboo, and was
used for beating time and for rhythmical purposes. The
slips being banded together at one end could be expanded
somewhat like a fan. The Chinese state that they used the
<dfn>ch’un-tu</dfn> for writing upon before they invented paper.</p>

<p>The <dfn>yü</dfn>, likewise an ancient Chinese instrument of percussion
and still in use, is made of wood in the shape of a
crouching tiger. It is hollow, and along its back are about
twenty small pieces of metal, pointed, and in appearance not
unlike the teeth of a saw. The performer strikes them with
a sort of plectrum resembling a brush, or with a small stick
called <dfn>chên</dfn>. Occasionally the <dfn>yü</dfn> is made with pieces of
metal shaped like reeds.</p>

<p>The ancient <dfn>yü</dfn> was constructed with only six tones which
were attuned thus&mdash;&#8203;<span class="decoration">f</span>, <span class="decoration">g</span>, <span class="decoration">a</span>, <span class="decoration">c</span>, <span class="decoration">d</span>, <span class="decoration">f</span>. The instrument appears
to have deteriorated in the course of time; for, although
it has gradually acquired as many as twenty-seven pieces
<!--Pg 062--><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pageno">41</span>
of metal, it evidently serves at the present day more for
the production of rhythmical noise than for the execution of
any melody. The modern <dfn>yü</dfn> is made of a species of wood
called <dfn>k’iu</dfn> or <dfn>ch’iu</dfn>; and the tiger rests generally on a hollow
wooden pedestal about three feet six inches long, which
serves as a sound-board.</p>

<p>The <dfn>chu</dfn>, likewise an instrument of percussion, was made
of the wood of a tree called <dfn>ch’iu-mu</dfn>, the stem of which
resembles that of the pine and whose foliage is much like that
of the cypress. It was constructed of boards about three-quarters
of an inch in thickness. In the middle of one of the
sides was an aperture into which the hand was passed for
the purpose of holding the handle of a wooden hammer, the
end of which entered into a hole situated in the bottom of
the <dfn>chu</dfn>. The handle was kept in its place by means of a
wooden pin, on which it moved right and left when the instrument
was struck with a hammer. The Chinese ascribe to
the <dfn>chu</dfn> a very high antiquity, as they almost invariably
do with any of their inventions when the date of its origin
is unknown to them.</p>

<p>The <dfn>po-fu</dfn> was a drum, about one foot four inches in length,
and seven inches in diameter. It had a parchment at each
end, which was prepared in a peculiar way by being boiled
in water. The <dfn>po-fu</dfn> used to be partly filled with a preparation
made from the husk of rice, in order to mellow the sound.
The Chinese name for the drum is <dfn>ku</dfn>.</p>

<p>The <dfn>chin-ku</dfn>, a large drum fixed on a pedestal which
raises it above six feet from the ground, is embellished
with symbolical designs. A similar drum on which natural
phenomena are depicted is called <dfn>lei-ku</dfn>; and another of
the kind, with figures of certain birds and beasts which are
regarded as symbols of long life, is called <dfn>ying-ku</dfn>, and
also <dfn>tsu-ku</dfn>.</p>

<p><!--Pg 063--><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="pageno">42</span>
The flutes, <dfn>ti</dfn>, <dfn>yüeh</dfn>, and <dfn>ch’ih</dfn> were generally made of bamboo.
The <dfn>kuan-tzŭ</dfn> was a Pandean pipe containing twelve tubes of
bamboo. The <dfn>hsiao</dfn>, likewise a Pandean pipe, contained
sixteen tubes. The <dfn>p’ai-hsiao</dfn> differed from the <dfn>hsiao</dfn> inasmuch
as the tubes were inserted into an oddly-shaped case highly
ornamented with grotesque designs and silken appendages.</p>

<p>The Chinese are known to have constructed at an early
period a curious wind-instrument, called <dfn>hsüan</dfn> (the “Chinese
ocarina") (<a href="#fig_11">Fig. 11</a>). It
was made of baked clay
and had five finger-holes,
three of which were
placed on one side and
two on the opposite side,
as in the cut. Its tones
were in conformity with
the pentatonic scale.
The reader unacquainted with the pentatonic scale may
ascertain its character by playing on the pianoforte the scale
of C major with the omission of <span class="decoration">f</span> and <span class="decoration">b</span> (the <span class="decoration">fourth</span> and <span class="decoration">seventh</span>);
or by striking the black keys in regular succession from
<span class="decoration">f</span>-sharp to the next <span class="decoration">f</span>-sharp above or below.</p>

<p>The <dfn>shêng</dfn> (<a href="#fig_12">Fig. 12<span class="decoration">b</span></a>) is one of the oldest instruments of
the Chinese still in use, and may be regarded as the most
ancient species of organ with which we are exactly acquainted.
Formerly it had either thirteen, nineteen, or twenty-four
tubes placed in a calabash; and a long curved tube
served as a mouth-piece. A similarly-constructed instrument,
though different in outward appearance, is the
<dfn>ken</dfn> of Siam and Burmah. The Siamese call the <dfn>ken</dfn>
“The Laos organ,” and it is principally used by the inhabitants
of the Laos states. Moreover, there deserves to be
noticed another Chinese instrument of this kind, simple in
construction, which probably represents the <dfn>shêng</dfn> in its most
primitive condition. It is to be found among the Miao-tsze,
or mountaineers, who are supposed to be the aboriginal inhabitants
of China. They call it <dfn>sang</dfn>. This species has no
bowl, or air-chest; it rather resembles the Panpipe, but is
sounded by means of a common mouthpiece consisting of a
tube, which is placed at a right angle across the pipes. The
Chinese assert that the <dfn>shêng</dfn> was used in olden time in the
religious rites performed in honour of Confucius. Tradescant
Lay, in his account of the Chinese, calls it “Jubal’s organ,”
and remarks, “this seems to be the embryo of our multiform
and magnificent organ."</p>

<p>The ancient stringed instruments, the <dfn>ch’in</dfn> (<a href="#fig_12">Fig. 12<span class="decoration">a</span></a>) and <dfn>sê</dfn>,
were of the dulcimer kind, they are still in use, and specimens
of them are in the Museum.</p>

<p>The <dfn>yueh-ch’in</dfn> (<a href="#fig_12">Fig. 12<span class="decoration">c</span></a>) is a favourite instrument of the
Chinese. The Canton pronunciation of <dfn>yueh-ch’in</dfn> is <dfn>yuet-kum</dfn>,
and this may be the reason why some European travellers
in China have called the instrument <dfn>gut-komm</dfn>. The wood of
which it is made is called by the Chinese <dfn>shwan-che</dfn>. The
strings are twanged with a plectrum, or with the nails, which,
it will be remembered, are grown by the Chinese to an extravagant
length.</p>

<p>The Buddhists introduced from Tibet into China their god
of music, who is represented as a rather jovial-looking man
with a moustache and an imperial, playing the <dfn>p’i-p’a</dfn>, a kind
of lute with four silken strings. Perhaps some interesting
information respecting the ancient Chinese musical instruments
may be gathered from the famous ruins of the Buddhist
temples <dfn>Angcor-Wat</dfn> and <dfn>Angcor-Thom</dfn>, in Cambodia. These
splendid ruins are supposed to be above two thousand years
old: and, at any rate, the circumstance of their age not being
known to the Cambodians suggests a high antiquity. On
<!--Pg 067--><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pageno">44</span>
the bas-reliefs with which the temples were enriched are
figured musical instruments, which European travellers
describe as “flutes, organs, trumpets, and drums, resembling
those of the Chinese.” Faithful sketches of these representations,
might, very likely, afford valuable hints to the student
of musical history.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The Japanese.</span></p>

<p>The Japanese musical instruments are in the main derived
from those of China, and their names consequently represent
the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese sounds.</p>

<p>The <dfn>biwa</dfn> (<a href="#fig_13">Fig. 13<span class="decoration">b</span></a>) is almost identical with the Chinese
<dfn>p’i-p’a</dfn>. The example illustrated is of wood, lacquered
black and ornamented with a band of Japanese design in
gold lacquer. It has four silken strings, and two very
small sound holes.</p>

<p>The <dfn>samisen</dfn> (the Chinese <dfn>san-hsien</dfn> or “three-stringed
guitar") is played especially by the Japanese ladies, and
is as great a favourite with them as the lute was formerly
with us. An example in the Museum (<a href="#fig_13">Fig. 13<span class="decoration">c</span></a>) has three
strings of silk. Both the <dfn>biwa</dfn> and the <dfn>samisen</dfn> are played
with a wooden plectrum. The <dfn>ko-kiū</dfn> is the Japanese violin,
and resembles a small <dfn>samisen</dfn>, but has four strings. It is
held head upwards and played with a loose-strung bow.</p>

<p>The Japanese have several instruments of the dulcimer
class, called <dfn>koto</dfn> (the Chinese <dfn>ch’in</dfn>) (<a href="#fig_13">Fig. 13<span class="decoration">a</span></a>). Some species
of the <dfn>koto</dfn> are played with <dfn>plectra</dfn> affixed to the fingers;
and there are different successions of intervals adopted in
the tuning of the several species.</p>

<p>The <dfn>ikuta-goto</dfn> is provided with thirteen movable bridges,
by means of which the pitch of the strings is regulated. The
bridges are of wood, and about 2½ inches in height. The
<dfn>ikuta-goto</dfn> is learnt chiefly by Japanese ladies moving in the
upper circles of society. It is a rather expensive instrument,
and requires much practice. The performer places it on the
floor, and, sitting in the usual Japanese attitude, bends
over it and twangs the strings with her fingers, the tips of
which are encased in <dfn>plectra</dfn>, resembling thimbles, which
terminate in a little projecting piece of ivory in size and
form like the finger nail.</p>

<p>Of wind instruments the Japanese use three principal
kinds:&mdash;&#8203;(1) The <dfn>fuye</dfn>, like our flute, with six or seven finger-holes;
(2) the <dfn>hichiriki</dfn>, a reed-flageolet, with seven finger-holes
and two thumb-holes; (3) the <dfn>shakuhachi</dfn>, a bamboo
pipe 20 inches high.</p>

<p>The <dfn>shêng</dfn> (described on <a href="#Page_42">p. 42</a>) is also popular in Japan.
The Japanese name for it is <dfn>shō</dfn>. The general name in
Japanese for the drum is <dfn>taiko</dfn> (= Chinese <dfn>ta ku</dfn>, “large
drum"). The Japanese have a great variety of drums,
some of which are used at religious ceremonies in the
temples. The <dfn>shime-daiko</dfn> is a shallow drum hung obliquely
before the player in a low wooden frame. It is beaten
with two plain sticks, and is used to accompany singers.
The <dfn>tsudzumi</dfn> is a small hand-drum with hour-glass-shaped
body.</p>

<p>The Japanese have different kinds of gongs (<dfn>dora</dfn> = Chinese
<dfn>t’ung-lo</dfn>, “copper gong"), which are used in the service
of the temple, in processions, at funerals, and on several
other solemn occasions. The <dfn>dōhachi</dfn> (= Chinese <dfn>t’ung
po</dfn>, “copper bowl") resembles a copper basin. Another
consists of two metal basins suspended by cords on a frame
composed of a pole and two cross-sticks.</p>

<p>The Japanese, as well as the Chinese, possess superbly
ornamented gongs (<dfn>kei</dfn>) raised on a stand. Those of the
former are perhaps the more magnificent.</p>

<p><!--Pg 071--><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pageno">46</span>
The Japanese employ large bells (<dfn>kane</dfn> or <dfn>tsuri-gane</dfn> =
Chinese <dfn>chung</dfn>) in their Buddhist worship. There is a famous
bell, richly decorated, near the Daibutsu at Kiōto, which is
struck, at different hours of the day, with a heavy wooden
mallet; and its sound is said to be particularly sonorous,
mellow, and far-reaching. Another celebrated Japanese bell
is placed on a high hill near the town of Nara. It is suspended
in a wooden shed, close to the Tōdaiji Temple. A thick pole,
affixed to the rafters, is drawn backwards, and then, by being
let loose, is made to rebound so as to hit the bell sideways in
the usual manner. This bell is admired throughout the
country, and pictures representing it are sold on the spot
to the visitors, who have to ascend a long flight of narrow
steps before they reach its station on the summit of the
hill. Small bells (<dfn>rin</dfn>) are used by the Buddhist priests in
Japan while officiating in the temple, just as is the case in
China, Thibet and other districts of the Asiatic continent.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The Hindus.</span></p>

<p>In the Brahmin mythology of the Hindus the demi-god
Nareda is the inventor of the <dfn>vina</dfn>, the principal national
instrument of Hindustan. His mother, Saraswati, the consort
of Brahma, may be regarded as the Minerva of the Hindus.
She is the goddess of music as well as of speech. To her is
attributed the invention of the systematic arrangement
of the sounds into a musical scale. She is represented seated
on a peacock and playing either on the southern <dfn>vina</dfn> or the
<dfn>bîn</dfn>, stringed instruments of the lute kind. Brahma himself
we occasionally find depicted as a vigorous man with four
handsome heads, beating with his hands upon a small drum;
and Vishnu, in his incarnation as Krishna, is represented
as a beautiful youth playing upon a flute. The Hindus
<!--Pg 072--><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pageno">47</span>
construct a peculiar kind of flute, the <dfn>bansi</dfn>, which they
consider as the favourite instrument of Krishna.</p>

<p>The <dfn>sankha</dfn>, or conch-shell trumpet of victory, one of the
important attributes of Vishnu the preserver, and his consort
Lakshmi, is occasionally represented in the possession of
Siva, and other deities. Siva the destroyer, and his consort
Parvati, also carry the <dfn>budbudika</dfn>, or <dfn>damaru</dfn>, a rattle-drum
shaped like an hour-glass.</p>

<p>It is a suggestive fact that we find among several nations
in different parts of the world an ancient tradition, according
to which their most popular stringed instrument was originally
derived from the water. Thus with Nareda and the <dfn>vina</dfn>,
the latter has also the name <dfn>kach’-hapi</dfn>, signifying a tortoise
(<dfn>testudo</dfn>), whilst <dfn>nara</dfn> denotes in Sanskrit water, and <dfn>narada</dfn>,
or <dfn>nareda</dfn>, the giver of water. Like Nareda, Nereus and his
fifty daughters, the Nereïdes, were much renowned for their
musical accomplishments; and Hermes (it will be remembered)
made his lyre, the <dfn>chelys</dfn>, of a tortoise-shell. The Scandinavian
god Odin, the originator of magic songs, is mentioned
as the ruler of the sea, and as such he had the name of <dfn>Nikarr</dfn>.
In the depth of the sea he played the harp with his subordinate
spirits, who occasionally came up to the surface of the water
to teach some favoured human being their wonderful instrument.
Wäinämöinen, the divine player on the Finnish
<dfn>kantele</dfn> (according to the Kalewala, the old national epic
of the Finns) constructed his instrument of fish-bones. The
frame he made out of the bones of the pike; and the teeth of
the pike he used for the tuning-pegs.</p>

<p>Jacob Grimm in his work on German mythology points out
an old tradition, preserved in Swedish and Scotch national
ballads, of a skilful harper who constructs his instrument
out of the bones of a young girl drowned by a wicked woman.
Her fingers he uses for the tuning screws, and her golden
<!--Pg 073--><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pageno">48</span>
hair for the strings. The harper plays, and his music kills
the murderess. A similar story is told in the old Icelandic
national songs; and the same tradition has been preserved
in the Faroe islands, as well as in Norway and Denmark.</p>

<p>May not the agreeable impression produced by the rhythmical
flow of the waves and the soothing murmur of running
water have led various nations, independently of each other,
to the widespread conception that they obtained their favourite
instrument of music from the water? Or is the notion
traceable to a common source dating from a pre-historic age,
perhaps from the early period when the Aryan race is surmised
to have diffused its lore through various countries? Or did it
originate in the old belief that the world, with all its charms
and delights, arose from a chaos in which water constituted
the predominant element?</p>

<p>Howbeit, Nareda, the giver of water, was the offspring of
Brahma the creator; and Odin had his throne in the skies.
Indeed, many of the musical water-spirits appear to have
been originally considered as rain deities. Their music may,
therefore, be regarded as derived from the clouds rather than
from the sea. In short, the traditions respecting spirits and
water are not in contradiction to the opinion of the ancient
Hindus that music is of heavenly origin, but rather tend to
support it.</p>

<p>The earliest musical instruments of the Hindus on record
have, almost all of them, remained in popular use until the
present day scarcely altered. Besides these, the Hindus
possess several Arabic and Persian instruments which are of
comparatively modern date in Hindustan: evidently having
been introduced into that country scarcely 1,000 years ago, at
the time of the Muhammadan irruption. There are several
treatises on music extant, written in Sanskrit, which contain
descriptions of the ancient instruments.</p>

<p>Of these the Bhârata Nâtya S’astra by Bhârata Muni
(period: <span class="sc">B.C.</span> 200 to <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 100), and the Sangita Ratnâkara,
are probably the oldest and most valuable. The latter,
according to information supplied by the late Major C. R.
Day, is an exhaustive work, consisting of seven ādhyayas,
compiled by Sarnga Deva, son of Sotala Deva, King of
Karnata, and grandson of Bhaskara, a Kashmirian (period:
so far undetermined).</p>

<p>The <dfn>vina</dfn> is undoubtedly of high antiquity. It has seven
wire strings, and movable frets which are generally fastened
with wax. Gourds, often tastefully ornamented, are affixed
for the purpose of increasing the sonorousness. There are
several kinds of the <dfn>vina</dfn> in different districts.</p>

<p>Concerning the two principal present-day derivations from
the ancient vina, the following abbreviated descriptions of the
<dfn>rudra vina</dfn> of Southern India and the <dfn>bîn</dfn> or <dfn>mahati vina</dfn> of
Northern India, are obtained from “The Music and Musical
Instruments of Southern India,” by the late Major C. R. Day
(London, 1891).</p>

<p>The <dfn>rudra vina</dfn> (<span class="decoration">see</span> <a href="#fig_14">Fig. 14<span class="decoration">b</span></a>) is composed of a pear-shaped
body of thin wood, hollowed out of the solid; wooden belly;
four principal metal strings passing over twenty-four frets
and three shorter wires placed at the side of the finger-board;
also a single detachable <dfn>burra</dfn>, or hollow gourd, fastened to the
under-side of the neck, near the head, to increase the volume
of sound. In the method of playing it differs from that of
other Indian musical instruments, the left hand being employed
to stop the strings on the frets, whilst the fingers,
or rather the finger-nails, of the right hand are used, without
plectra, for striking. The <dfn>bîn</dfn>, or <dfn>mahali vina</dfn>, differs from
the <dfn>rudra vina</dfn> in shape and in method of playing. Two
large gourd-resonators replace the wooden body with its
small <dfn>burra</dfn>; the side strings are placed two on the left
<!--Pg 077--><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pageno">50</span>
side and one upon the right; the frets vary from nineteen
to twenty-two in number; and in playing, the two first fingers
of the right hand are armed with wire plectra.</p>

<p>The <dfn>sârangi</dfn>, or the common fiddle of Southern India
(<a href="#fig_14">Fig. 14<span class="decoration">c</span></a>) has a wooden body hollowed out of a single block,
a parchment belly, three strings of thick gut, and usually
fifteen sympathetic strings of wire, tuned chromatically.
Sometimes a fourth principal string of wire, called <dfn>luruj</dfn>, is
added. It is played with a bow, the instrument being held
vertically, head uppermost; the tone resembling that of the
viola. The <dfn>sârangi</dfn> of Northern India, usually carved with a
conventional swan-shaped head, has a rounded body, and
possesses a lesser number of sympathetic wires.</p>

<p>The <dfn>sârinda</dfn>, or Bengal fiddle (<a href="#fig_14">Fig. 14<span class="decoration">a</span></a>), another of the few
bowed instruments of India, consists of a hollow wooden body,
usually decorated with carving, a curious parchment belly
covering only the lower half of the body, and three strings
either of gut or silk.</p>

<p>The Hindus divided their musical scale into several intervals
smaller than our modern semitones. They adopted twenty-two
intervals called <dfn>s’ruti</dfn> in the compass of an octave, which
may therefore be compared to our chromatic intervals. As
the frets of the <dfn>vina</dfn> are movable the performer can easily
regulate them according to the scale, or mode, which he
requires for his music.</p>

<p>The harp has long been obsolete. If some Hindu drawings
of it can be relied upon, it had at an early time a triangular
frame and was in construction as well as in shape and size
almost identical with the Assyrian harp.</p>

<p>The Hindus claim to have invented the violin bow. They
maintain that the <dfn>ravanastra</dfn>, one of their old instruments
played with the bow, was invented about 5,000 years ago by
Ravana, a mighty king of Ceylon. However this may be,
<!--Pg 078--><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="pageno">51</span>
there is a great probability that the fiddle-bow originated in
Hindustan; because Sanskrit scholars inform us that there
are names for it in works which cannot be less than from
1,500 to 2,000 years old. The non-occurrence of any instrument
played with a bow on the monuments of the nations of
antiquity is by no means so sure a proof as has generally
been supposed, that the bow was unknown. The fiddle in its
primitive condition must have been a poor contrivance.
It probably was despised by players who could produce better
tones with greater facility by twanging the strings with their
fingers, or with a plectrum. Thus it may have remained
through many centuries without experiencing any material
improvement. It must also be borne in mind that the monuments
transmitted to us chiefly represent historical events,
religious ceremonies, and royal entertainments. On such
occasions instruments of a certain kind only were used, and
these we find represented; while others, which may have been
even more common, never occur. In 2,000 years’ time
people will possibly maintain that some highly perfected
instrument popular with them was entirely unknown to us,
because it is at present in so primitive a condition that no one
hardly notices it.</p>

<p>"What the <dfn>ravanastra</dfn>, or <dfn>râbanastra</dfn>, was like is rather
doubtful, but at the present time there exists in Ceylon a
primitive instrument played with a bow, called <dfn>vinavah</dfn>, which
has two strings of different kinds, one made of a species
of flax, and the other of horsehair, which is the material also
of the string of the bow…. The hollow part of this instrument
is half a cocoa-nut shell polished, covered with the
dried skin of a lizard, and perforated below.” (Day, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 102.)</p>

<p>This instrument again is almost identical with the Chinese
fiddle called <dfn>ur-heen</dfn>, which also has two strings, and a body
consisting of a small block of wood, hollowed out and covered
<!--Pg 079--><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pageno">52</span>
with the skin of a serpent. The <dfn>ur-heen</dfn> has not been mentioned
among the most ancient instruments of the Chinese, since
there is no evidence of its having been known in China before
the introduction of the Buddhist religion into that country.
From indications, which to point out would lead too far here,
it would appear that several instruments found in China
originated in Hindustan. They seem to have been gradually
diffused from Hindustan and Thibet, more or less altered
in the course of time, through the East as far as Japan.</p>

<p>Another curious Hindu instrument, probably of very high
antiquity, is the <dfn>pungi</dfn>, or <dfn>jinagovi</dfn>, also called <dfn>toumrie</dfn> and
<dfn>magoudi</dfn>. It consists of a gourd or of the <dfn>cuddos</dfn> nut,
hollowed, into which two reed-pipes are inserted. The <dfn>pungi</dfn>
therefore, somewhat resembles in appearance a bagpipe.
It is generally used by the <dfn>saperá</dfn> or snake-charmer, who
plays upon it when exhibiting the antics of the cobra. The
name <dfn>magoudi</dfn>, given in certain districts to this instrument,
rather tends to corroborate the opinion of some musical
historians that the <dfn>magadis</dfn> of the ancient Greeks was a sort
of double-pipe, or bagpipe.</p>

<p>Many instruments of Hindustan are known by different
names in different districts, and there are many varieties.
On the whole, the Hindus possess about fifty instruments.
To describe them properly would fill a volume. Some,
which are in the Museum, will be found well described and
illustrated in the previously mentioned work by the late
Major C. R. Day, which, in addition to affording much valuable
information to the student and collector, contains a lengthy
bibliography of Indian music and musical instruments.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">The Persians and Arabs.</span></p>

<p>Of the musical instruments of the ancient Persians, before
the Christian era, scarcely anything is known. It may be
<!--Pg 080--><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pageno">53</span>
surmised that they closely resembled those of the Assyrians,
and probably also those of the Hebrews.</p>

<p>The harp, <dfn>chang</dfn>, in olden time a favourite instrument of the
Persians, has gradually fallen into desuetude. A small harp
is represented in the celebrated sculptures which exist on
a stupendous rock, called Tak-i-Bostan, in the vicinity of the
town of Kermanshah. These sculptures are said to have
been executed during the lifetime of the Persian monarch
Chosroes <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> (591-628). They form the ornaments of two
lofty arches, and consist of representations of field sports
and aquatic amusements. In one of the boats is seated
a man in an ornamental dress, with a halo round his head,
who is receiving an arrow from one of his attendants;
while a female, who is sitting near him, plays on a Trigonon.
Towards the top of the bas-relief is represented a stage, on
which are performers on small straight trumpets and little
hand drums; six harpers; and four other musicians, apparently
females&mdash;&#8203;the first of whom plays a flute; the second,
a sort of Pandean pipe; the third, an instrument which is too
much defaced to be recognisable; and the fourth, a bagpipe.
Two harps of a peculiar shape were copied by Sir Gore Ousely
from Persian manuscripts about four hundred years old,
resembling, in the principle on which they are constructed,
all other oriental harps. There existed evidently various
kinds of the <dfn>chang</dfn>. It may be remarked here that the instrument
<dfn>tschenk</dfn> (or <dfn>chang</dfn>) in use at the present day in Persia,
is more like a dulcimer than a harp. The Arabs adopted
the harp from the Persians, and called it <dfn>junk</dfn>.</p>

<p>The Persians appear to have adopted, at an early period,
smaller musical intervals than semitones. When the Arabs
conquered Persia (<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 641) the Persians had already attained
a higher degree of civilisation than their conquerors. The
latter found in Persia the cultivation of music considerably
<!--Pg 081--><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pageno">54</span>
in advance of their own, and the musical instruments superior
also. They soon adopted the Persian instruments, and
there can be no doubt that the musical system exhibited by
the earliest Arab writers whose works on the theory of music
have been preserved was based upon an older system of the
Persians. In these works the octave is divided in seventeen
<dfn>one-third-tones</dfn>&mdash;&#8203;intervals which are still made use of in the
East. Some of the Arabian instruments are constructed
so as to enable the performer to produce the intervals with
exactness. The frets on the lute and tamboura, for instance,
are regulated with a view to this object.</p>

<p>The Arabs had to some extent become acquainted with
many of the Persian instruments before the time of their
conquest of Persia. An Arab musician of the name of Nadr
Ben el-Hares Ben Kelde is recorded as having been sent to
the Persian King Chosroes <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, in the sixth century, for
the purpose of learning Persian singing and performing on
the lute. Through him, it is said, the lute was brought to
Mekka. Saib Chatir, the son of a Persian, is spoken of as
the first performer on the lute in Medina, <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 682; and of an
Arab lutist, Ebn Soreidsch from Mekka, <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 683, it is especially
mentioned that he played in the Persian style; evidently
the superior one. The lute, <dfn>el-ood</dfn>, had before the tenth
century only four strings, or four pairs producing four tones,
each tone having two strings tuned in unison. About the
tenth century a string for a fifth tone was added. The strings
were made of silk neatly twisted. The neck of the instrument
was provided with frets of string, which were carefully regulated
according to the system of seventeen intervals in the
compass of an octave before mentioned. Other favourite
stringed instruments were the <dfn>tamboura</dfn>, a kind of lute with
a long neck, and the <dfn>quanūn</dfn>, a kind of dulcimer strung with
lamb’s gut strings (generally three in unison for each tone)
and played upon with two little plectra which the performer
had fastened to his fingers. The <dfn>quanūn</dfn> is likewise still in
use in countries inhabited by Muhammadans. The Persian
<dfn>santir</dfn>, the prototype of our dulcimer, is mounted with wire
strings and played with two slightly curved sticks. The
musician depicted in the left-hand corner of <a href="#fig_15">Fig. 15<span class="decoration">c</span></a> is
playing a <dfn>santir</dfn>.</p>

<p>Al-Farabi, one of the earliest Arabian musical theorists
known, who lived in the beginning of the tenth century, does
not allude to the fiddle-bow. This is noteworthy inasmuch as
it seems in some measure to support the opinion maintained
by some historians that the bow originated in England or
Wales. Unfortunately we possess no exact descriptions of
the Persian and Arabian instruments between the tenth and
fourteenth centuries, otherwise we should probably have
earlier accounts of some instrument of the violin kind in
Persia. Ash-shakandi, who lived in Spain about <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1200,
mentions the <dfn>rabôb</dfn>, which may have been in use for centuries
without having been thought worthy of notice on account
of its rudeness. Persian writers of the fourteenth century
speak of two instruments of the violin class, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, the <dfn>rabôb</dfn>
and the <dfn>kemángeh</dfn>. As regards the <dfn>kemángeh</dfn>, the Arabs themselves
assert that they obtained it from Persia, and their
statement appears all the more worthy of belief from the fact
that both names, <dfn>rabôb</dfn> and <dfn>kemángeh</dfn>, are originally Persian.</p>

<p>The <dfn>nuy</dfn>, a flute (<a href="#fig_15">Fig. 15<span class="decoration">b</span></a>), and the <dfn>surnai</dfn>, a species of
oboe, are still popular in the East.</p>

<p>The <dfn>sitâra</dfn> is a Persian three stringed instrument with a
wooden body and a parchment belly (<a href="#fig_15">Fig. 15<span class="decoration">a</span></a>).</p>

<p>The Arabs must have been indefatigable constructors
of musical instruments. Kiesewetter gives a list of above
two hundred names of Arabian instruments, and this does
not include many known to us through Spanish historians.
<!--Pg 085--><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="pageno">56</span>
A careful investigation of the musical instruments of the
Arabs during their sojourn in Spain is particularly interesting
to the student of mediæval music, inasmuch as it reveals the
Eastern origin of many instruments which are generally
regarded as European inventions. Introduced into Spain
by the Saracens and the Moors they were gradually diffused
towards northern Europe. The English, for instance,
adopted not only the Moorish dance (morris dance) but also
the <dfn>kuitra</dfn> (gittern), the <dfn>el-ood</dfn> (lute), the <dfn>rabôb</dfn> (rebec), the
<dfn>naḳḳárah</dfn> (naker), and several others. In an old Cornish
sacred drama, supposed to date from the fourteenth century,
we have in an enumeration of musical instruments the <dfn>nakrys</dfn>,
designating “kettle-drums.” It must be remembered that
the Cornish language, which has now become obsolete, was
nearly akin to the Welsh. Indeed, names of musical instruments
derived from the Moors in Spain occur in almost
every European language.</p>

<p>Not a few fanciful stories are traditionally preserved
among the Arabs testifying to the wonderful effects they
ascribed to the power of their instrumental performances.
One example will suffice. Al-Farabi had acquired his proficiency
in Spain, in one of the schools at Cordova which
flourished as early as towards the end of the ninth century,
and his reputation became so great that ultimately it extended
to Asia. The mighty Caliph of Bagdad himself
desired to hear the celebrated musician, and sent messengers
to Spain with instructions to offer rich presents to him and
to convey him to the court. But Al-Farabi feared that if
he went he should be retained in Asia, and should never
again see the home to which he felt deeply attached. At
last he resolved to disguise himself, and ventured to undertake
the journey which promised him a rich harvest. Dressed
in a mean costume, he made his appearance at the court
<!--Pg 086--><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pageno">57</span>
just at the time when the caliph was being entertained with
his daily concert. Al-Farabi, unknown to everyone, was
permitted to exhibit his skill on the lute. Scarcely had he
commenced his performance in a certain musical mode
when he set all his audience laughing aloud, notwithstanding
the efforts of the courtiers to suppress so unbecoming an
exhibition of mirth in the royal presence. In truth, even
the caliph himself was compelled to burst out into a fit of
laughter. Presently the performer changed to another
mode, and the effect was that immediately all his hearers
began to sigh, and soon tears of sadness replaced the previous
tears of mirth. Again he played in another mode, which
excited his audience to such a rage that they would have
fought each other if he, seeing the danger, had not directly
gone over to an appeasing mode. After this wonderful
exhibition of his skill Al-Farabi concluded in a mode which
had the effect of making his listeners fall into a profound
sleep, during which he took his departure.</p>

<p>It will be seen that this incident is almost identical with
one recorded as having happened about twelve hundred
years earlier at the court of Alexander the Great, and which
forms the subject of Dryden’s “Alexander’s Feast.” The
distinguished flutist Timotheus successively aroused and
subdued different passions by changing the musical modes
during his performance, exactly in the same way as did
Al-Farabi.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">AMERICAN INDIAN.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">If</span> the preserved antiquities of the American Indians,
dating from a period anterior to our discovery of the western
hemisphere, possess an extraordinary interest because
they afford trustworthy evidence of the degree of progress
which the aborigines had attained in the cultivation of the
arts and in their social condition before they came in contact
with Europeans, it must be admitted that the ancient musical
instruments of the American Indians are also worthy of
examination. Several of them are constructed in a manner
which, in some degree, reveals the characteristics of the
musical system prevalent among the people who used the
instruments. And although most of these interesting relics,
which have been obtained from tombs and other hiding-places,
may not be of great antiquity, it has been satisfactorily
ascertained that they are genuine contrivances of the Indians
before they were influenced by European civilisation.</p>

<p>Some account of these relics is therefore likely to prove of
interest also to the ethnologist, especially as several facts may
perhaps be found of assistance in elucidating the still unsolved
problem as to the probable original connection of the
American with Asiatic races.</p>

<p>Among the instruments of the Aztecs in Mexico and of the
Peruvians none have been found so frequently, and have
been preserved in their former condition so unaltered, as
pipes and flutes. They are generally made of pottery or of
bone, substances which are unsuitable for the construction
<!--Pg 088--><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="pageno">59</span>
of most other instruments, but which are remarkably well
qualified to withstand the decaying influence of time. There
is, therefore, no reason to conclude from the frequent occurrence
of such instruments that they were more common
than other kinds of which specimens have rarely been
discovered.</p>

</div>

<p>The Mexicans possessed a small whistle formed of baked
clay, a considerable number of which have been found.
Some specimens (<a href="#fig_16">Fig. 16</a>) are singularly grotesque in shape,
representing caricatures of the human face and figure, birds,
beasts, and flowers. Some were provided at the top with a
finger-hole which, when closed, altered the pitch of the
sound, so that two different tones were producible on the
instrument. Others had a little ball of baked clay lying
loose inside the air-chamber. When the instrument was
blown the current of air set the ball in a vibrating motion,
<!--Pg 089--><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pageno">60</span>
thereby causing a shrill and whirring sound. A similar
contrivance is sometimes made use of by Englishmen for
conveying signals. The Mexican whistle most likely served
principally the same purpose, but it may possibly have been
used also in musical entertainments. In the Russian horn
band each musician is restricted to a single tone; and similar
combinations of performers&mdash;&#8203;only, of course, much more
rude&mdash;&#8203;have been witnessed by travellers among some tribes
in Africa and America.</p>

<p>Rather more complete than the above specimens are some
of the whistles and small pipes which have been found in
graves of the Indians of Chiriqui in Central America.</p>

<p>The pipe of the Aztecs, which is called by the Mexican
Spaniards <dfn>pito</dfn>, somewhat resembled our flageolet: the
material was a reddish pottery, and it was provided with
four linger holes. Although among about half a dozen specimens
which the writer has examined some are considerably
larger than others, they all have, singularly enough, the same
pitch of sound. The smallest is about six inches in length,
and the largest about nine inches. Several <dfn>pitos</dfn> have been
found in a remarkably well-preserved condition. They are
easy to blow, and their order of intervals is in conformity
with the pentatonic scale, thus: <sub><img src="images/m060.jpg" width="20%" alt="music snippet" /></sub> The
usual shape of the <dfn>pito</dfn> is that here represented (<a href="#fig_17">Fig. 17<span class="decoration">a</span> &amp; <span class="decoration">c</span></a>).
A specimen of a less common shape, is given in <a href="#fig_17">Fig. 17<span class="decoration">b</span></a>.
They are all in the British Museum. Indications suggestive
of the popular estimation in which the flute (or perhaps,
more strictly speaking, the pipe) was held by the Aztecs are
not wanting. It was played in religious observances, and we
find it referred to allegorically in orations delivered on solemn
occasions. For instance, at the religious festival which was
held in honour of Tezcatlepoca&mdash;&#8203;a divinity depicted as a
handsome youth, and considered second only to the supreme
being&mdash;&#8203;a young man was sacrificed who, in preparation for the
ceremony, had been instructed in the art of playing the flute.
Twenty days before his death four young girls, named after
the principal goddesses, were given to him as companions;
and when the hour arrived in which he was to be sacrificed he
observed the established symbolical rite of breaking a flute
on each of the steps, as he ascended the temple.</p>

<p>Again, at the public ceremonies which took place on the
accession of a prince to the throne the new monarch addressed
a prayer to the god, in which occurred the following allegorical
expression:&mdash;&#8203;"I am thy flute; reveal to me thy will;
breathe into me thy breath like into a flute, as thou hast
done to my predecessors on the throne. As thou hast opened
their eyes, their ears, and their mouth to utter what is good,
so likewise do to me. I resign myself entirely to thy guidance.”
Similar sentences occur in the orations addressed to the
monarch. In reading them one can hardly fail to be reminded
of Hamlet’s reflections addressed to Guildenstern,
when the servile courtier expresses his inability to “govern
the ventages” of the pipe and to make the instrument
“discourse most eloquent music,” which the prince bids
him to do.</p>

<p>M. de Castelnau, in his “Expédition dans l’Amérique,”
gives among the illustrations of objects discovered in ancient
Peruvian tombs a flute made of a human bone. It has four
finger holes at its upper surface and appears to have been blown
into at one end. Two bone flutes (<a href="#fig_18">Figs. 18<span class="decoration">b</span> &amp; <span class="decoration">c</span></a>), in appearance
similar to the engraving given by M. de Castelnau, which
have been disinterred at Truxillo, are deposited in the British
Museum. They are about six inches in length, and each
is provided with five finger holes. One of these has all the
<!--Pg 093--><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pageno">62</span>
holes at its upper side, and one of the holes is considerably
smaller than the rest. The specimen which we illustrate
(<a href="#fig_18">Fig. 18<span class="decoration">a</span></a>) is ornamented with some simple designs in black.</p>

<p>The other has four holes at its upper side and one underneath,
the latter being placed near to the end at which the
instrument evidently was blown. In the aperture of this
end some remains of a hardened paste, or resinous substance,
are still preserved. This substance probably was inserted
for the purpose of narrowing the end of the tube, in order
to facilitate the producing of the sounds. The same contrivance
is still resorted to in the construction of the bone
flutes by some Indian tribes in Guiana. The bones of slain
enemies appear to have been considered especially appropriate
for such flutes. The Araucanians having killed a prisoner,
made flutes of his bones, and danced and “thundered out
their dreadful war songs, accompanied by the mournful
sounds of these horrid instruments.” Alonso de Ovalle says
of the Indians in Chili: “Their flutes, which they play
upon in their dances, are made of the bones of the Spaniards
and other enemies whom they have overcome in war. This
they do by way of triumph and glory for their victory. They
make them likewise of bones of animals; but the warriors
dance only to the flutes made of their enemies.” The
Mexicans and Peruvians obviously possessed a great variety
of pipes and flutes, some of which are still in use among
certain Indian tribes. Those which were found in the famous
ruins at Palenque are deposited in the museum in Mexico.
They are:&mdash;&#8203;The <dfn>cuyvi</dfn>, a pipe on which only five tones were
producible; the <dfn>huayllaca</dfn>, a sort of flageolet; the <dfn>pincullu</dfn>,
a flute; and the <dfn>chayna</dfn>, which is described as “a flute
whose lugubrious and melancholy tones filled the heart
with indescribable sadness, and brought involuntary tears
into the eyes.” It was perhaps a kind of oboe.</p>

<p><!--Pg 094--><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pageno">63</span>
The Peruvians had the syrinx, which they called <dfn>huayra-puhura</dfn>.
Some clue to the proper meaning of this name
may perhaps be gathered from the word <dfn>huayra</dfn>, which
signifies “air.” The <dfn>huayra-puhura</dfn> was made of cane, and
also of stone. Sometimes an embroidery of needlework
was attached to it as an ornament. One specimen which
has been disinterred is adorned with twelve figures precisely
resembling Maltese crosses. The cross is a figure which
may readily be supposed to suggest itself very naturally;
and it is therefore not so surprising, as it may appear at a
first glance, that the American Indians used it not unfrequently
in designs and sculptures before they came in
contact with Christians.</p>

<p>The British Museum possesses a <dfn>huayra-puhura</dfn> consisting
of fourteen reed pipes of a brownish colour, tied together in
two rows by means of thread, so as to form a double set of
seven reeds. Both sets are almost exactly of the same dimensions
and are placed side by side. The shortest of these
reeds measure three inches, and the longest six and a half.
In one set they are open at the bottom, and in the other they
are closed. Consequently octaves are produced. The reader
is probably aware that the closing of a pipe at the end raises
its pitch an octave. Thus, in our organ, the so-called stopped
diapason, a set of closed pipes, requires tubes of only half the
length of those which constitute the open diapason, although
both these stops produce tones in the same pitch; the only
difference between them being the quality of sound, which
in the former is less bright than in the latter.</p>

<p>The tones yielded by the <dfn>huayra-puhura</dfn> in question are as
follows: <sub><img src="images/m063.jpg" width="20%" alt="music snippet" /></sub> The highest octave is
indistinct, owing to some injury done to the shortest tubes;
<!--Pg 095--><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pageno">64</span>
but sufficient evidence remains to show that the intervals
were purposely arranged according to the pentatonic scale.
This interesting relic was brought to light from a tomb at Arica.</p>

<p>Another <dfn>huayra-puhura</dfn> (<a href="#fig_19">Fig. 19</a>), likewise still yielding
sounds, was discovered placed over a corpse in a Peruvian
tomb, and was procured by the French general, Paroissien.
This instrument is made of soapstone, and contains eight
pipes. It now belongs to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Canon J. H. Rawdon.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span>

In the Museum may
be seen a good plaster
cast taken from this
curious relic. The height
is five and three-quarter
inches, and its width
six and a quarter
inches. Four of the
tubes have small lateral
finger-holes, which, when
closed, lower the pitch
a semitone. These holes
are on the second, fourth, six, and seventh pipe, as
shown in the engraving. When the holes are open, the
tones are: <sub><img src="images/m064a.jpg" width="20%" alt="music snippet" /></sub> and when they are closed:
<sub><img src="images/m064b.jpg" width="20%" alt="music snippet" /></sub> The other tubes have unalterable tones.
The following notation exhibits all the tones producible on
the instrument: <sub><img src="images/m064c.jpg" width="40%" alt="music snippet" /></sub></p>

<p>The musician is likely to speculate what could have induced
<!--Pg 096--><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><span class="pageno">65</span>
the Peruvians to adopt so strange a series of intervals: it
seems rather arbitrary than premeditated.</p>

<p>If (and this seems not to be improbable) the Peruvians considered
those tones which are produced by closing the lateral
holes as additional intervals only, a variety of scales or kinds
of <dfn>modes</dfn> may have been contrived by the admission of one
or other of these tones among the essential
ones. If we may conjecture from some
remarks of Garcilasso de la Vega, and
other historians, the Peruvians appear to
have used different orders of intervals
for different kinds of tunes, in a way
similar to what we find to be the case
with certain Asiatic nations. We are
told, for instance, “Each poem, or song,
had its appropriate tune, and they could
not put two different songs to one tune;
and this was why the enamoured gallant,
making music at night on his flute, with
the tune which belonged to it, told the
lady and all the world the joy or sorrow
of his soul, the favour or ill-will which he
possessed; so that it might be said that
he spoke by the flute.” Thus also the
Hindus have certain tunes for certain
seasons and fixed occasions, and likewise
a number of different modes or scales
used for particular kinds of songs.</p>

In the Museum at Kew Gardens.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#fig_20">Fig. 20</a> represents a kind of trumpet made of wood, and
nearly seven feet in length, which Gumilla found among
the Indians in the vicinity of the Orinoco. It somewhat
resembles the <dfn>juruparis</dfn> (<a href="#fig_21">Fig. 21</a>), a mysterious instrument of
the Indians on the Rio Haupés, a tributary of the Rio Negro,
South America. The <dfn>juruparis</dfn> is regarded as an object of
great veneration. Women are never permitted to see it.
So stringent is this law that any woman obtaining a sight of
it is put to death&mdash;&#8203;usually by poison. No youths are allowed
to see it until they have been subjected to a series of initiatory
fastings and scourgings. The <dfn>juruparis</dfn> is usually kept hidden
in the bed of some stream, deep in the forest; and no one
dares to drink out of that sanctified stream, or to bathe in its
water. At feasts the <dfn>juruparis</dfn> is brought out during the
night, and is blown outside the houses of entertainment.
The inner portion of the instrument consists of a tube made
of slips of the Paxiaba palm (<dfn>Triartea exorrhiza</dfn>). When the
Indians are about to use the instrument they nearly close the
upper end of the tube with clay, and also tie above the oblong
<!--Pg 098--><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pageno">67</span>
square hole (shown in the engraving) a portion of the leaf of
the Uaruma, one of the arrow-root family. Round the tube
are wrapped long strips of the tough bark of the Jébaru (<dfn>Parivoa
grandiflora</dfn>). This covering descends in folds below the
tube. The length of the instrument is from four to five feet.
The illustration (<a href="#fig_21">Fig. 21</a>), which exhibits the <dfn>juruparis</dfn> with
its cover and without it, has been taken from a specimen in
the museum at Kew gardens. The mysteries connected with
this trumpet are evidently founded on an old tradition from
prehistoric Indian ancestors. <dfn>Jurupari</dfn> means “demon";
and with several Indian tribes on the Amazon customs and
ceremonies still prevail in honour of Jurupari.</p>

<p>The Caroados, an Indian tribe in Brazil, have a war trumpet
which closely resembles the <dfn>juruparis</dfn>. With this people it is
the custom for the chief to give on his war trumpet the signal
for battle, and to continue blowing as long as he wishes the
battle to last. The trumpet is made of wood, and its sound is
described by travellers as very deep but rather pleasant.
The sound is easily produced, and its continuance does not
require much exertion; but a peculiar vibration of the lips is
necessary which requires practice. Another trumpet, the
<dfn>turé</dfn>, is common with many Indian tribes on the Amazon
who use it chiefly in war. It is made of a long and thick
bamboo, and there is a split reed in the mouthpiece. It
therefore partakes rather of the character of an oboe or
clarinet. Its tone is described as loud and harsh. The
<dfn>turé</dfn> is especially used by the sentinels of predatory hordes,
who, mounted on a lofty tree, give the signal of attack to their
comrades.</p>

<p>Again, the aborigines in Mexico had a curious contrivance of
this kind, the <dfn>acocotl</dfn>, now more usually called <dfn>clarin</dfn>. The
former word is its old Indian name, and the latter appears to
have been first given to the instrument by the Spaniards. The
<!--Pg 099--><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pageno">68</span>
<dfn>acocotl</dfn> consists of a very thin tube from eight to ten feet in
length, and generally not quite straight but with some irregular
curves. This tube, which is often not thicker than a couple of
inches in diameter, terminates at one end in a sort of bell, and
has at the other end a small mouthpiece resembling in shape
that of a clarinet. The tube is made of the dry stalk of a
plant which is common in Mexico, and which likewise the
Indians call <dfn>acocotl</dfn>. The most singular characteristic of the
instrument is that the performer does not blow into it, but
inhales the air through it; or rather, he produces the sound by
sucking the mouthpiece. It is said to require strong lungs to
perform on the <dfn>acocotl</dfn> effectively according to Indian notions
of taste.</p>

 <p class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 22.</span>&mdash;<span class="sc">Botuto</span>, used by Indians near the Orinoco.</p>
</div>

<p>The <dfn>botuto</dfn>, which Gumilla saw used by some tribes near the
<!--Pg 100--><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pageno">69</span>
river Orinoco (<a href="#fig_22">Fig. 22</a>), was evidently an ancient Indian
contrivance, but appears to have fallen almost into oblivion
during the last two centuries. It was made of baked clay
and was commonly from three to four feet long; but some
trumpets of this kind were of enormous size. The <dfn>botuto</dfn> with
two bellies was usually made thicker than that with three
bellies and emitted a deeper sound, which is described as
having been really terrific. These trumpets were used on
occasions of mourning and funeral dances. Alexander von
Humboldt saw the <dfn>botuto</dfn> among some Indian tribes near the
river Orinoco.</p>

<p>Besides those which have been noticed, other antique wind
instruments of the Indians are mentioned by historians; but
the descriptions given of them are too superficial to convey a
distinct notion as to their form and purport. Several of these
barbarous contrivances scarcely deserve to be classed with
musical instruments. This may, for instance, be said of certain
musical jars or earthen vessels producing sounds, which the
Peruvians constructed for their amusement. These vessels
were made double; and the sounds imitated the cries of
animals or birds. A similar contrivance of the Indians in
Chili, preserved in the museum at Santiago, is described by
the traveller S. S. Hill as follows:&mdash;&#8203;"It consists of two
earthen vessels in the form of our india-rubber bottles, but
somewhat larger, with a flat tube from four to six inches in
length, uniting their necks near the top and slightly curved
upwards, and with a small hole on the upper side one third of
the length of the tube from one side of the necks. To produce
the sounds the bottles were filled with water and suspended
to the bough of a tree, or to a beam, by a string attached to the
middle of the curved tube, and then swung backwards and
forwards in such a manner as to cause each end to be alternately
the highest and lowest, so that the water might pass backwards
<!--Pg 101--><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pageno">70</span>
and forwards from one bottle to the other through the tube
between them. By this means soothing sounds were produced
which, it is said, were employed to lull to repose the drowsy
chiefs who usually slept away the hottest hours of the day.
In the meantime, as the bottles were porous, the water within
them diminished by evaporation, and the sound died gradually
away."</p>

<p>As regards instruments of percussion, a kind of drum deserves
special notice on account of the ingenuity evinced in its construction.
The Mexicans called it <dfn>teponaztli</dfn>. They generally
made it of a single block of very hard wood, somewhat oblong
square in shape, which they hollowed, leaving at each end a
solid piece about three or four inches in thickness, and at its
upper side a kind of sound-board about a quarter of an inch
in thickness. In this sound-board, if it may be called so, they
made three incisions; namely, two running parallel some distance
lengthwise of the drum, and a third running across from
one of these to the other just in the centre. By this means they
obtained two vibrating tongues of wood which, when beaten
with a stick, produced sounds as clearly defined as are those
of our kettle drums. By making one of the tongues thinner
than the other they ensured two different sounds, the pitch of
which they were enabled to regulate by shaving off more or
less of the wood. The bottom of the drum they cut almost
entirely open. The traveller, M. Nebel, was told by archæologists
in Mexico that these instruments always contained the
interval of a third, but on examining several specimens which
he saw in museums he found some in which the two sounds
stood towards each other in the relation of a fourth; while
in others they constituted a fifth, in others a sixth, and in some
even an octave. This is noteworthy in so far as it points to a
conformity with our diatonic series of intervals, excepting the
seventh.</p>
<!--Pg 102--><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pageno">71</span>

<p>The <dfn>teponaztli</dfn> was generally carved with various fanciful
and ingenious designs. It was beaten with two drumsticks
covered at the end with an elastic gum, called <dfn>ule</dfn>, which
was obtained from the milky juice extracted from the
ule-tree. Some of these drums were small enough to be
carried on a string or strap suspended round the neck of
the player; others, again, measured upwards of 5 feet in
length, and their sound was so powerful that it could be heard
at a distance of three miles. In some rare instances a specimen
of the <dfn>teponaztli</dfn> is still preserved by the Indians in
Mexico, especially among tribes who have been comparatively
but little affected by intercourse with their European aggressors.
Herr Heller saw such an instrument in the hands
of the Indians of Huatusco&mdash;&#8203;a village near Mirador in the
Tierra Templada, or temperate region, occupying the slopes
of the Cordilleras. Its sound is described as so very loud as
to be distinctly audible at an incredibly great distance. This
circumstance, which has been noticed by several travellers,
may perhaps be owing in some measure to the condition of
the atmosphere in Mexico.</p>

<p>Instruments of percussion constructed on a principle more
or less similar to the <dfn>teponaztli</dfn> were in use in several other
parts of America, as well as in Mexico.</p>

<p>The largest kind of Mexican <dfn>teponaztli</dfn> appears to have been
generally of a cylindrical shape. Clavigero gives a drawing of
such an instrument. Drums, also constructed of skin or parchment
in combination with wood were not unknown to the
Indians. Of this description was, for instance, the <dfn>huehuetl</dfn>
of the Aztecs in Mexico, which consisted, according to Clavigero,
of a wooden cylinder somewhat above 3 feet in height,
curiously carved and painted and covered at the top with
carefully prepared deer-skin. And, what appears the most
remarkable, the parchment (we are told) could be tightened
<!--Pg 103--><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pageno">72</span>
or slackened by means of cords in nearly the same way as with
our own drum. The <dfn>huehuetl</dfn> was not beaten with drumsticks
but merely struck with the fingers, and much dexterity
was required to strike it in the proper manner. Oviedo
states that the Indians in Cuba had drums which were
stretched with human skin. And Bernal Diaz relates that
when he was with Cortés in Mexico they ascended together the
<dfn>Teocalli</dfn> ("House of God"), a large temple in which human
sacrifices were offered by the aborigines; and there the
Spanish visitors saw a large drum which was made, Diaz
tells us, with skins of great serpents. This “hellish instrument,”
as he calls it, produced, when struck, a doleful sound
which was so loud that it could be heard at a distance of
two leagues.</p>

<p>The name of the Peruvian drum was <dfn>huanca</dfn>; they had
also an instrument of percussion, called <dfn>chhilchiles</dfn>, which
appears to have been a sort of tambourine.</p>

<p>The rattle was likewise popular with the Indians before
the discovery of America. The Mexicans called it <dfn>ajacaxtli</dfn>.
In construction it was similar to the rattle at the present
day commonly used by the Indians. It was oval or round
in shape, and appears to have been usually made of a gourd
into which holes were pierced, and to which a wooden handle
was affixed. A number of little pebbles were enclosed in the
hollowed gourd. They were also made of pottery. The
little balls in the <dfn>ajacaxtli</dfn> of pottery, enclosed as they are,
may at a first glance appear a puzzle. Probably, when the
rattle was being formed they were attached to the inside
as slightly as possible; and after the clay had been baked
they were detached by means of an implement passed through
the holes.</p>

<p>The Tezcucans (or Acolhuans) belonged to the same race as
the Aztecs, whom they greatly surpassed in knowledge and
<!--Pg 104--><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pageno">73</span>
social refinement. Nezahualcoyotl, a wise monarch of the
Tezcucans, abhorred human sacrifices, and erected a large
temple which he dedicated to “The unknown god, the cause
of causes.” This edifice had a tower nine storeys high, on the
top of which were placed a number of musical instruments of
various kinds which were used to summon the worshippers
to prayer. Respecting these instruments especial mention is
made of a sonorous metal which was struck with a mallet. This
is stated in a historical essay written by Ixtlilxochitl, a native
of Mexico and of royal descent, who lived in the beginning
of the seventeenth century, and who may be supposed to have
been familiar with the musical practices of his countrymen.
But whether the sonorous metal alluded to was a gong or a
bell is not clear from the vague record transmitted to us.
That the bell was known to the Peruvians appears to be no
longer doubtful, since a small copper specimen has been found
in one of the old Peruvian tombs. This interesting relic
is now deposited in the museum at Lima. M. de Castelnau has
published a drawing of it. The Peruvians called their bells
<dfn>chanrares</dfn>; but it remains questionable whether this name
did not designate rather the so-called horse bells, which were
certainly known to the Mexicans, who called them <dfn>yotl</dfn>. It
is noteworthy that these <dfn>yotl</dfn> are found figured in the picture-writings
representing the various objects which the Aztecs
used to pay as tribute to their sovereigns. The collection
of Mexican antiquities in the British Museum contains a
cluster of yotl-bells. Being nearly round, they closely resemble
the <dfn>Schellen</dfn> which the Germans are in the habit of
affixing to their horses, particularly in the winter when they
are driving their noiseless sledges.</p>

<p>Again, in South America sonorous stones are not unknown,
and were used in olden time for musical purposes. The traveller
G. T. Vigne saw among the Indian antiquities preserved
<!--Pg 105--><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pageno">74</span>
in the town of Cuzco, in Peru, “a musical instrument of
green sonorous stone, about a foot long, and an inch and a half
wide, flat-sided, pointed at both ends, and arched at the back,
where it was about a quarter of an inch thick, whence it
diminished to an edge, like the blade of a knife…. In the
middle of the back was a small hole, through which a piece of
string was passed; and when suspended and struck by any
hard substance a singularly musical note was produced.” Humboldt
mentions the Amazon-stone, which on being struck by a
hard substance yields a metallic sound. It was formerly cut
by the American Indians into very thin plates, perforated in
the centre and suspended by a string. These plates were
remarkably sonorous. This kind of stone is not, as might
be conjectured from its name, found exclusively near the
Amazon. The name was given to it as well as to the river by
the first European visitors to America, in allusion to the
female warriors respecting whom strange stories are told.
The natives pretending, according to an ancient tradition,
that the stone came from the country of “Women without
husbands,” or “Women living alone."</p>

<p>As regards the ancient stringed instruments of the American
Indians our information is indeed but scanty. Clavigero says
that the Mexicans were entirely unacquainted with stringed
instruments; a statement the correctness of which is questionable,
considering the stage of civilisation to which these
people had attained. At any rate, we generally find one or
other kind of such instruments with nations whose intellectual
progress and social condition are decidedly inferior. The
Aztecs had many claims to the character of a civilised community
and (as before said) the Tezcucans were even more
advanced in the cultivation of the arts and sciences than the
Aztecs. “The best histories,” Prescott observes, “the best
poems, the best code of laws, the purest dialect, were all
<!--Pg 106--><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pageno">75</span>
allowed to be Tezcucan. The Aztecs rivalled their neighbours
in splendour of living, and even in the magnificence of their
structures. They displayed a pomp and ostentatious
pageantry, truly Asiatic.” Unfortunately historians are
sometimes not sufficiently discerning in their communications
respecting musical questions. J. Ranking, in describing the
grandeur of the establishment maintained by Montezuma, says
that during the repasts of this monarch “there was music of
fiddle, flute, snail-shell, a kettle-drum, and other strange
instruments.” But as this waiter does not indicate the source
whence he drew his information respecting Montezuma’s
orchestra including the fiddle, the assertion deserves scarcely a
passing notice.</p>

<p>The Peruvians possessed a stringed instrument, called <dfn>tinya</dfn>,
which was provided with five or seven strings. To conjecture
from the unsatisfactory account of it transmitted to us, the
<dfn>tinya</dfn> appears to have been a kind of guitar. Considering the
fragility of the materials of which such instruments are generally
constructed, it is perhaps not surprising that we do not
meet with any specimens of them in the museums of American
antiquities.</p>

<p>A few remarks will not be out of place here referring to
the musical performances of the ancient Indians, since an
acquaintance with the nature of the performances is likely to
afford additional assistance in appreciating the characteristics
of the instruments. In Peru, where the military system was
carefully organised, each division of the army had its trumpeters,
called <dfn>cqueppacamayo</dfn>, and its drummers, called
<dfn>huancarcamayo</dfn>. When the Inca returned with his troops
victorious from battle his first act was to repair to the temple
of the Sun in order to offer up thanksgiving; and after the
conclusion of this ceremony the people celebrated the event
with festivities, of which music and dancing constituted a
<!--Pg 107--><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pageno">76</span>
principal part. Musical performances appear to have been
considered indispensable on occasions of public celebrations;
and frequent mention is made of them by historians who have
described the festivals annually observed by the Peruvians.</p>

<p>About the month of October the Peruvians celebrated a
solemn feast in honour of the dead, at which ceremony they
executed lugubrious songs and plaintive instrumental music.
Compositions of a similar character were performed on occasion
of the decease of a monarch. As soon as it was made known
to the people that their Inca had been “called home to the
mansions of his father the sun” they prepared to celebrate
his obsequies with becoming solemnity. Prescott, in his
graphic description of these observances, says: “At stated
intervals, for a year, the people assembled to renew the expressions
of their sorrow; processions were made displaying
the banner of the departed monarch; bards and minstrels
were appointed to chronicle his achievements, and their songs
continued to be rehearsed at high festivals in the presence
of the reigning monarch&mdash;&#8203;thus stimulating the living by the
glorious example of the dead.” The Peruvians had also
particular agricultural songs, which they were in the habit of
singing while engaged in tilling the lands of the Inca; a duty
which devolved upon the whole nation. The subject of these
songs, or rather hymns, referred especially to the noble deeds
and glorious achievements of the Inca and his dynasty.
While thus singing, the labourers regulated their work to the
rhythm of the music, thereby ensuring a pleasant excitement
and a stimulant in their occupation, like soldiers regulating
their steps to the music of the military band. These hymns
pleased the Spanish invaders so greatly that they not only
adopted several of them but also composed some in a similar
form and style. This appears, however, to have been the case
rather with the poetry than with the music.</p>

<p><!--Pg 108--><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pageno">77</span>
The name of the Peruvian elegiac songs was <dfn>haravi</dfn>. Some
tunes of these songs, pronounced to be genuine specimens,
have been published in recent works; but their genuineness
is questionable. At all events they must have been much
tampered with, as they exhibit exactly the form of the Spanish
<dfn>bolero</dfn>. Even allowing that the melodies of these compositions
have been derived from Peruvian <dfn>harivaris</dfn>, it is impossible to
determine with any degree of certainty how much in them
has been retained of the original tunes, and how much has
been supplied besides the harmony, which is entirely an addition
of the European arranger. The Peruvians had minstrels,
called <dfn>haravecs</dfn> (<span class="decoration">i.e.</span>, “inventors"), whose occupation it was to
compose and to recite the <dfn>haravis</dfn>.</p>

<p>The Mexicans possessed a class of songs which served as a
record of historical events. Furthermore they had war-songs,
love-songs, and other secular vocal compositions, as well as
sacred chants, in the practice of which boys were instructed
by the priests in order that they might assist in the musical
performances of the temple. It appertained to the office of
the priests to burn incense, and to perform music in the temple
at stated times of the day. The commencement of the
religious observances which took place regularly at sunrise, at
mid-day, at sunset, and at midnight, was announced by signals
blown on trumpets and pipes. Persons of high position retained
in their service professional musicians whose duty it was
to compose ballads, and to perform vocal music with instrumental
accompaniment. The nobles themselves, and occasionally
even the monarch, not infrequently delighted in
composing ballads and odes.</p>

<p>Especially to be noticed is the institution termed “Council
of music,” which the wise monarch Nezahualcoyotl founded in
Tezcuco. This institution was not intended exclusively for
promoting the cultivation of music; its aim comprised the
<!--Pg 109--><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><span class="pageno">78</span>
advancement of various arts, and of sciences such as history,
astronomy, etc. In fact, it was an academy for general
education. Probably no better evidence could be cited
testifying to the remarkable intellectual attainments of the
Mexican Indians before the discovery of America than this
council of music. Although in some respects it appears to
have resembled the board of music of the Chinese, it was
planned on a more enlightened and more comprehensive
principle. The Chinese “board of music,” called <dfn>Yoh Pu</dfn>, is
an office connected with the <dfn>Li Pu</dfn> or “board of rites,”
established by the imperial government at Peking. The
principal object of the board of rites is to regulate the ceremonies
on occasions of sacrifices offered to the gods; of
festivals and certain court solemnities; of military reviews;
of presentations, congratulations, marriages, deaths, burials&mdash;&#8203;in
short, concerning almost every possible event in social
and public life.</p>

<p>The reader is probably aware that in one of the various
hypotheses which have been advanced respecting the Asiatic
origin of the American Indians China is assigned to them as
their ancient home. Some historians suppose them to be
emigrants from Mongolia, Thibet, or Hindustan; others
maintain that they are the offspring of Phœnician colonists
who settled in Central America. Even more curious are the
arguments of certain inquirers who have no doubt whatever
that the ancestors of the American Indians were the lost ten
tribes of Israel, of whom since about the time of the Babylonian
captivity history is silent. Whatever may be thought as to
which particular one of these speculations hits the truth,
they certainly have all proved useful, in so far as they have
made ethnologists more exactly acquainted with the habits
and predilections of the American aborigines than would
otherwise have been the case. For, as the advocates of each
<!--Pg 110--><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><span class="pageno">79</span>
hypothesis have carefully collected and adduced every evidence
they were able to obtain tending to support their views, the
result is that (so to say) no stone has been left unturned.
Nevertheless, any such hints as suggest themselves from an
examination of musical instruments have hitherto remained
unheeded. It may therefore perhaps interest the reader
to have his attention drawn to a few suggestive similarities
occurring between instruments of the American Indians and
of certain nations inhabiting the eastern hemisphere.</p>

<p>We have seen that the Mexican pipe and the Peruvian
syrinx were purposely constructed so as to produce the
intervals of the pentatonic scale only. There are some additional
indications of this scale having been at one time in
use with the American Indians. For instance, the music
of the Peruvian dance <dfn>cachua</dfn> is described as having been
very similar to some Scotch national dances; and the most
conspicuous characteristics of the Scotch tunes are occasioned
by the frequently exclusive employment of intervals appertaining
to the pentatonic scale. We find precisely the same
series of intervals adopted on certain Chinese instruments,
and evidences are not wanting of the pentatonic scale having
been popular among various races in Asia at a remote period.
The series of intervals appertaining to the Chiriqui pipe,
mentioned on <a href="#Page_60">p. 60</a>, consisted of a semitone and two whole
tones, like the <dfn>tetrachord</dfn> of the ancient Greeks.</p>

<p>In the Peruvian <dfn>huayra-puhura</dfn> made of soapstone some of the
pipes possess lateral holes. This contrivance, which is rather
unusual, occurs on the Chinese <dfn>shêng</dfn>. The <dfn>chayna</dfn>, mentioned
on <a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>, seems to have been provided with a reed, like the
oboe: and in Hindustan we find a species of oboe called
<dfn>shehna</dfn>. The <dfn>turé</dfn> of the Indian tribes on the Amazon, mentioned
on <a href="#Page_67">p. 67</a>, reminds us of the trumpets <dfn>turi</dfn>, or <dfn>tuturi</dfn>, of
the Hindus. The name appears to have been known also to
<!--Pg 111--><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pageno">80</span>
the Arabs; but there is no indication whatever of its having
been transmitted to the peninsula by the Moors, and afterwards
to South America by the Portuguese and Spaniards.</p>

<p>The wooden tongues in the drum <dfn>teponaztli</dfn> may be considered
as a contrivance exclusively of the ancient American
Indians. Nevertheless a construction nearly akin to it may
be observed in certain drums of the Tonga and Fiji islanders,
and of the natives of some islands in Torres Strait. Likewise
some negro tribes in Western and Central Africa have certain
instruments of percussion which are constructed on a principle
somewhat reminding us of the <dfn>teponaztli</dfn>. The method of
bracing the drum by means of cords, as exhibited in the
<dfn>huehuetl</dfn> of the Mexican Indians, is evidently of very high
antiquity in the East. It was known to the ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p>Rattles, Pandean pipes made of reed, and conch trumpets,
are found almost all over the world, wherever the materials of
which they are constructed are easily obtainable. Still,
it may be noteworthy that the Mexicans employed the conch
trumpet in their religious observances apparently in much
the same way as it is used in the Buddhist worship of the
Tibetans and Kalmuks.</p>

<p>As regards the sonorous metal in the great temple at Tezcuco
some inquirers are sure that it was a gong: but it must be
borne in mind that these inquirers detect everywhere traces
proving an invasion of the Mongols, which they maintain to
have happened about six hundred years ago. Had they
been acquainted with the little Peruvian bell they would
have had more tangible musical evidence in support of their
theory than the supposed gong; for this bell certainly bears
a suggestive resemblance to the little hand-bell which the
Buddhists use in their religious ceremonies.</p>

<p>The Peruvians interpolated certain songs, especially those
which they were in the habit of singing while cultivating
<!--Pg 112--><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pageno">81</span>
the fields, with the word <dfn>hailli</dfn> which signified “Triumph.”
As the subject of these compositions was principally the
glorification of the Inca, the burden <dfn>hailli</dfn> is perhaps all the
more likely to remind Europeans of the Hebrew <dfn>hallelujah</dfn>.
Moreover, Adair, who lived among the Indians of North
America during a period of about forty years, speaks of some
other words which he found used as burdens in hymns sung
on solemn occasions, and which appeared to him to correspond
with certain Hebrew words of a sacred import.</p>

<p>As regards the musical accomplishments of the Indian
tribes at the present day they are far below the standard
which we have found among their ancestors. A period of
three hundred years of oppression has evidently had the
effect of subduing the melodious expressions of happiness
and contentedness which in former times appear to have been
quite as prevalent with the Indians as they generally are
with independent and flourishing nations. The innate talent
for music evinced by those of the North American Indians who
were converted to Christianity soon after the emigration of the
Puritans to New England is very favourably commented on
by some old writers. In the year 1661 John Elliot published
a translation of the psalms into Indian verse. The singing
of these metrical psalms by the Indian converts in their
places of worship appears to have been actually superior to
the sacred vocal performances of their Christian brethren
from Europe; for we find it described by several witnesses as
“excellent” and “most ravishing.</p>

<p>In other parts of America the priests from Spain did
not neglect to turn to account the susceptibility of the
Indians for music. Thus, in central America the Dominicans
composed as early as in the middle of the sixteenth century a
sacred poem in the Guatemalian dialect containing a narrative
of the most important events recorded in the Bible. This
<!--Pg 113--><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pageno">82</span>
production they sang to the natives, and to enhance the effect
they accompanied the singing with musical instruments. The
alluring music soon captivated the heart of a powerful cazique,
who was thus induced to adopt the doctrines embodied in
the composition, and to diffuse them among his subjects,
who likewise delighted in the performances. In Peru a
similar experiment, resorted to by the priests who accompanied
Pizarro’s expedition, proved equally successful. They
dramatised certain scenes in the life of Christ and represented
them with music, which so greatly fascinated the Indians
that many of them readily embraced the new faith. Nor
are these entertainments dispensed with even at the present
day by the Indian Christians, especially in the village churches
of the Sierra in Peru; and as several religious ceremonies
have been retained by these people from their heathen forefathers,
it may be conjectured that their sacred musical
performances also retain much of their ancient heathen
character.</p>

<p>Most of the musical instruments found among the American
Indians at the present day are evidently genuine old Indian
contrivances as they existed long before the discovery of
America. Take, for example, the peculiarly-shaped rattles,
drums, flutes, and whistles of the North American Indians, of
which some specimens in the Museum are described in the
large catalogue. A few African instruments, introduced by
the negro slaves, are now occasionally found in the hands
of the Indians, and have been by some travellers erroneously
described as genuine Indian inventions. This is the case
with the African <dfn>marimba</dfn>, which has become rather popular
with the natives of Guatemala in central America; but
such adaptations are very easily discernible.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">EUROPEAN INSTRUMENTS OF THE MIDDLE
AGES.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Many</span> representations of musical instruments of the middle
ages have been preserved in manuscripts, as well as in sculptures
and paintings forming ornamental portions of churches
and other buildings. Valuable facts and hints are obtainable
from these evidences, provided they are judiciously selected
and carefully examined. The subject is, however, so large
that only a few observations on the most interesting instruments
can be offered here. Unfortunately there still prevails
much uncertainty respecting several of the earliest representations
as to the precise century from which they date,
and there is reason to believe that in some instances the
archæological zeal of musical investigators has assigned a
higher antiquity to such discoveries than can be satisfactorily
proved.</p>

<p>It appears certain that the most ancient European instruments
known to us were in form and construction more
like the Asiatic than was the case with later ones. Before
a nation has attained to a fairly high degree of civilisation
its progress in the cultivation of music, as an art, is very slow
indeed. The instruments found at the present day in Asia
are scarcely superior to those which were in use among oriental
nations about three thousand years ago. It is, therefore,
perhaps not surprising that no material improvement is perceptible
in the construction of the instruments of European
countries during the lapse of nearly a thousand years. True,
<!--Pg 115--><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pageno">84</span>
evidences to be relied on referring to the first five or six centuries
of the Christian era are but scanty; although indications
are not wanting which may help the reflecting musician.</p>

<p>There are some early monuments of Christian art dating
from the fourth century in which the lyre is represented. In
one of them Christ is depicted as Apollo touching the lyre.
This instrument occurs at an early period in western Europe
as used in popular pastimes. In an Anglo-Saxon manuscript
of the ninth century in the British Museum (Cleopatra C. <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>)
are the figures of two gleemen, one playing the lyre and the
other a double-pipe. M. de Coussemaker has published in
the “Annales Archéologiques” the figure of a crowned
personage playing the lyre, which he found in a manuscript
of the ninth or tenth century in the library at Angers. The
player twangs the strings with his fingers, while the Anglo-Saxon
gleeman before mentioned uses a plectrum.</p>

<p><dfn>Cithara</dfn> was a name applied to several stringed instruments
greatly varying in form, power of sound, and compass. The
illustration (<a href="#fig_23">Fig. 23</a>) represents a cithara from a manuscript
of the ninth century,
formerly in the library
of the great monastery
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blasius in the
Black Forest. When in
the year 1768 the monastery
was destroyed by
fire, this valuable book
perished in the flames; fortunately the celebrated Abbot
Gerbert possessed tracings of the illustrations, which were
saved from destruction. He published them, in the year 1774,
in his work “De cantu et musica sacra.” As the older works
on music were generally written in Latin we do not learn
from them the popular names of the instruments; the writers
<!--Pg 116--><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pageno">85</span>
merely adopted such
Latin names as they
thought the most appropriate.
Thus, for
instance, a very
simple stringed instrument
of a triangular
shape, and a somewhat
similar one of
a square shape (Fig.
24), were designated
by the name of
<dfn>psalterium</dfn>.</p>

upon the triangular psalterium (<a href="#fig_26">Fig. 26</a>), because it has a
sort of small sound-board at the top. Scarcely better, with

</div>

<p>The Anglo-Saxons frequently accompanied their vocal
effusions with a harp, more or less triangular in shape, an
instrument which may be considered rather as constituting
the transition of the lyre into the harp. The harp was
especially popular in central and northern Europe, and
was the favourite instrument of the German and Celtic
bards and of the Scandinavian skalds. In the next illustration
(<a href="#fig_29">Fig. 29</a>) from the manuscript of the monastery
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blasius twelve strings and two sound-holes are given
to it. A harp similar in form and size, but without the
<!--Pg 119--><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pageno">88</span>
front pillar, was known to the ancient Egyptians. Perhaps
the addition was also non-existent in the earliest specimens
appertaining to European nations; and a sculptured figure
of a small harp constructed like the ancient eastern harp has
been discovered in the old church of Ullard in the county
of Kilkenny. This curious relic, which is said to date from
a period anterior to the year 800, is illustrated in Bunting’s
“Ancient Music of Ireland.” As Bunting was the first who
drew attention to this sculpture his account of it may interest
the reader. “The drawing,” he says, “is taken from one of
the ornamental compartments of a sculptured cross, at the
old church of Ullard. From the style of the workmanship,
as well as from the worn condition of the cross, it seems older
than the similar monument at Monasterboice which is known
to have been set up before the year 830. The sculpture is
rude; the circular rim which binds the arms of the cross
together is not pierced in the quadrants, and many of the
figures originally in relievo are now wholly abraded. It is
difficult to determine whether the number of strings represented
is six or seven; but, as has been already remarked,
accuracy in this respect cannot be expected either in sculptures
or in many picturesque drawings.” The Finns had a
harp (<dfn>harpu</dfn>, <dfn>kantele</dfn>) with a similar frame, devoid of a front
pillar, still in use until the commencement of the last century.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting stringed instruments of the
middle ages is the <dfn>rotta</dfn> (German, <dfn>Rotte</dfn>; English, <dfn>rote</dfn>). It
was sounded by twanging the strings, and also by the application
of the bow. The first method was, of course, the elder
one. There can hardly be a doubt that when the bow came
into use it was applied to certain popular instruments which
previously had been treated like the <dfn>cithara</dfn> or the <dfn>psalterium</dfn>.
The Hindus at the present day use their <dfn>suroda</dfn> sometimes as
a lute and sometimes as a fiddle. In some measure we do the
<!--Pg 120--><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pageno">89</span>
same with the violin by playing occasionally <dfn>pizzicato</dfn>. The
rotta from the manuscript of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blasius is called in Gerbert’s
work <dfn>cithara teutonica</dfn>, while the harp is called <dfn>cithara
anglica</dfn>; from which it would appear that the former was
regarded as pre-eminently a German instrument. Possibly
its name may have been originally <dfn>chrotta</dfn> and the continental
nations may have adopted it from the Celtic races of the
British isles, dropping the guttural sound. This hypothesis
is, however, one of those which have been advanced by
some musical historians without any satisfactory evidence.</p>

<p>In the <dfn>rotta</dfn> the ancient Asiatic lyre is easily to be recognized.
An illumination of king David playing the <dfn>rotta</dfn> forms
the frontispiece of a manuscript of the eighth century preserved
in the cathedral library of Durham; it is musically
interesting inasmuch as it represents a <dfn>rotta</dfn> of an oblong
square shape like that just noticed and resembling the Welsh
<dfn>crwth</dfn>. It has only five strings which the performer twangs
with his fingers. Again, a very interesting representation
of the Psalmist with a kind of <dfn>rotta</dfn> occurs in a
manuscript of the tenth century, in the British Museum
(Vitellius F.<abbr title="eleven">XI.</abbr>). The manuscript was much injured by
a fire in the year 1731; but Professor Westwood has succeeded,
with great care, and with the aid of a magnifying
glass, in making out the lines of the figure. As it has been
ascertained that the psalter is written in the Irish semiuncial
character it is highly probable that the kind of <dfn>rotta</dfn> represents
the Irish <dfn>cionar cruit</dfn>, which was played by twanging the
strings and also by the application of a bow. Unfortunately
we possess no well-authenticated representation of the Welsh
<dfn>crwth</dfn> of an early period; otherwise we should in all probability
find it played with the fingers, or with a plectrum. Venantius
Fortunatus, an Italian who lived in the second half of the
sixth century, mentions in a poem the “Chrotta Britanna.”
<!--Pg 121--><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pageno">90</span>
He does not, however, allude to the bow, and there is no
reason to suppose that it existed in England. Howbeit,
the Welsh <dfn>crwth</dfn> (Anglo-Saxon, <dfn>crudh</dfn>; English, <dfn>crowd</dfn>) is only
known as a species of fiddle closely resembling the <dfn>rotta</dfn>, but
having a fingerboard in the middle of the open frame and
being strung with only a few strings; while the <dfn>rotta</dfn> had
sometimes above twenty strings. As it may interest the
reader to examine the form of the modern <dfn>crwth</dfn> we give an
illustration of it (<a href="#fig_30">Fig. 30</a>). Edward Jones, in his “Musical
and poetical relicks of the Welsh bards,” records that the
Welsh had before this kind of <dfn>crwth</dfn> a three-stringed one called
“Crwth Trithant,” which was, he says, “a sort of violin, or
more properly a rebeck.” The three-stringed <dfn>crwth</dfn> was chiefly
used by the inferior class of bards; and was probably the
Moorish fiddle which is still the favourite instrument of the
itinerant bards of the Bretons in France, who call it <dfn>rébek</dfn>. The
Bretons, it will be remembered, are close kinsmen of the Welsh.</p>

<p>A player on the <dfn>crwth</dfn> or <dfn>crowd</dfn> (a crowder) from a bas-relief
on the under part of the seats of the choir in Worcester
cathedral dates from the latter part of the fourteenth century.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span>

It was probably identical with the <dfn>rotta</dfn> of the same century
on the continent.</p>

<p>An interesting drawing of an Anglo-Saxon fiddle&mdash;&#8203;or
<dfn>fithele</dfn>, as it was called&mdash;&#8203;is given in a manuscript of the
eleventh century in the British Museum (Cotton, Tiberius,
c. 6). The instrument is of a pear shape, with four strings,
and the bridge is not indicated. A German fiddle of the
ninth century, called <dfn>lyra</dfn>, copied by Gerbert from the manuscripts
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blasius, has only one string. Other records of
the employment of the fiddle-bow in Germany in the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries are not wanting. For instance, in
the famous “Nibelungenlied” Volker is described as wielding
the fiddle-bow not less dexterously than the sword. And in
“Chronicon picturatum Brunswicense” of the year 1203,
the following miraculous sign is recorded as having occurred
in the village of Ossemer: “On Wednesday in Whitsunweek,
while the parson was fiddling to his peasants who were
dancing, there came a flash of lightning and struck the parson’s
arm which held the fiddle-bow, and killed twenty-four
people on the spot."</p>

<p>Among the oldest representations of performers on instruments
of the violin kind found in England those deserve to
be noticed which are painted on the interior of the roof of
Peterborough Cathedral. They are said to date from the
twelfth century. One of these figures is particularly interesting
on account of the surprising resemblance which his
instrument bears to our present violin. Not only the incurvations
on the sides of the body but also the two sound-holes
are nearly identical in shape with those made at the present
day. Respecting the reliance to be placed on such evidence,
it is necessary to state that the roof, originally constructed
between the years 1177 and 1194, was thoroughly repaired
in the year 1835. Although we find it asserted that “the
greatest care was taken to retain every part, or to restore it
to its original state, so that the figures, even where retouched,
are in effect the same as when first painted,” it nevertheless
remains a debatable question whether the restorers have not
admitted some slight alterations, and have thereby somewhat
modernised the appearance of the instruments. A
slight touch with the brush at the sound-holes, the screws,
or the curvatures would suffice to produce modifications
which might to the artist appear as being only a renovation
of the original representation, but which to the musical investigator
greatly impair the value of the evidence. Sculptures are,
therefore, more to be relied upon in evidence than frescoes.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The</span> construction of the <dfn>organistrum</dfn> (<a href="#fig_31">Fig. 31</a>) requires but
little explanation. A glance at the finger-board reveals at once
that the different tones were obtained by raising the keys
placed on the neck under the strings, and that the keys were
raised by means of the handles at the side of the neck. Of
the two bridges shown on the body, the one situated nearest
the middle was formed by a wheel in the inside, which projected
through the sound-board. The wheel which slightly
touched the strings vibrated them by friction when turned
by the handle at the end. The order of intervals was <span class="decoration">c</span>, <span class="decoration">d</span>, <span class="decoration">e</span>,
<span class="decoration">f, g, a, b-flat, b-natural, c</span>, and were obtainable on the highest
string. There is reason to suppose that the other two strings
were generally tuned a fifth and an octave below the highest.
The <dfn>organistrum</dfn> may be regarded as the predecessor of the
hurdy-gurdy, and was rather a cumbrous contrivance. Two
persons seem to have been required to sound it, one to turn
the handle and the other to manage the keys. Thus it is generally
represented in mediæval concerts.</p>

<p>The <dfn>monochord</dfn> was mounted with a single string stretched
over two bridges which were fixed on an oblong box. The
string could be tightened or slackened by means of a turning
screw inserted into one end of the box. The intervals of the
scale were marked on the side, and were regulated by a sort
of movable bridge placed beneath the string when required.
As might be expected, the <dfn>monochord</dfn> was chiefly used by
theorists; for any musical performance it was but little
<!--Pg 126--><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span class="pageno">93</span>
suitable. About a thousand
years ago when this monochord
was in use the musical
scale was diatonic, with the
exception of the interval of
the seventh, which was chromatic
inasmuch as both <span class="decoration">b-flat</span>
and <span class="decoration">b-natural</span> formed part of
the scale.</p>

<p>This ought to be borne
in mind in examining the
representations of musical
instruments transmitted to
us from that period.</p>

<p>As regards the wind instruments
popular during the
Middle Ages, some were of
quaint form as well as of rude
construction.</p>

<p>The <dfn>chorus</dfn>, or <dfn>choron</dfn>, had
either one or two tubes. There
were several varieties of this
instrument; sometimes it was
constructed with a bladder
into which the tube is inserted;
this kind of <dfn>chorus</dfn>
resembled the bagpipe;
another kind resembled the
<dfn>pungi</dfn> of the Hindus, mentioned
on page 52. The name
<dfn>chorus</dfn> was also applied to
certain stringed instruments.
One of these had much the
<!--Pg 127--><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pageno">94</span>
form of the <dfn>cithara</dfn>, page 84. It appears, however, probable
that <dfn>chorus</dfn> or <dfn>choron</dfn> originally designated a horn (Hebrew,
<dfn>keren</dfn>; Greek, <dfn>keras</dfn>; Latin, <dfn>cornu</dfn>).</p>

<p>The flutes of the Middle Ages were blown at the end, like the
flageolet. Of the <dfn>syrinx</dfn> there are extant some illustrations of
the ninth and tenth centuries, which exhibit the instrument
with a number of tubes tied together, just like the Pandean
pipe still in use. In one specimen,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span>
 from a manuscript of the
eleventh century, the tubes were inserted into a bowl-shaped
box. This is probably the <dfn>frestele</dfn>, <dfn>fretel</dfn>, or <dfn>fretian</dfn>, which in
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries was in favour with the
French ménétriers.</p>

<p>Some large Anglo-Saxon trumpets may be seen in a manuscript
of the eighth century in the British Museum. The
largest kind of trumpet was placed on a stand when blown. Of
the <dfn>oliphant</dfn>, or hunting horn, some fine specimens are in the
Victoria and Albert Museum collection. The <dfn>sackbut</dfn> (Fig.
32), probably made of
metal, could be drawn
out to alter the pitch
of sound. The sackbut
of the ninth century
had, however, a very
different shape to that
in use about three
centuries ago, and much more resembled the present <dfn>trombone</dfn>.
The name <dfn>sackbut</dfn> is supposed to be a corruption of <dfn>sambuca</dfn>.
The French, about the fifteenth century, called it <dfn>sacqueboute</dfn>
and <dfn>saquebutte</dfn>.</p>

which was erected in Constantinople under Theodosius the Great
towards the end of the fourth century. The bellows were
pressed by men standing on them. This interesting monument
also exhibits performers on the double flute. The
<dfn>hydraulic organ</dfn>, which is recorded to have been already known
about two hundred years before the Christian era, was according
to some statements occasionally employed in churches during
the earlier centuries of the Middle Ages. Probably it was more
frequently heard in secular entertainments, for which it was
more suitable; and at the beginning of the fourteenth century
it appears to have been entirely supplanted by the pneumatic
organ. The earliest organs had only about a dozen pipes.
The largest, which were made about nine hundred years ago,
had only three octaves, in which the chromatic intervals did
not occur. Some progress in the construction of the organ is
shewn in a psalter of Eadwine, in the library of Trinity College,
Cambridge (<a href="#fig_33">Fig. 33</a>). The instrument has ten pipes, or perhaps
fourteen, as four of them appear to be double pipes.
<!--Pg 129--><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pageno">96</span>
It required four men exerting all their power to produce
the necessary wind, and two men to play the instrument.
Moreover, both players seem also to be busily engaged in
directing the blowers about the proper supply of wind.
Six men and only fourteen pipes!</p>

<p>The pedal is
generally believed
to have been invented
by Bernhard,
a German,
who lived in Venice
about the year
1470. There are,
however, indications
extant pointing
to an earlier
date of its invention. Perhaps Bernhard was the first who, by
adopting a more practicable construction, made the pedal
more generally known. On the earliest organs the keys of the
finger-board were of enormous size, compared with those
of the present day; so that a finger-board with only nine keys
had a breadth of from four to five feet. The organist struck
the keys down with his fist, as is done in playing the <dfn>carillon</dfn>
still in use on the Continent, of which presently some account
will be given.</p>

<p>Of the little portable organ, known as the <dfn>regal</dfn> or <dfn>regals</dfn>,
often tastefully shaped and embellished, some interesting
sculptured representations are still extant in the old ecclesiastical
edifices of England and Scotland. There is, for instance,
<!--Pg 130--><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="pageno">97</span>
in Beverley Minster a figure of a man playing on a single regal,
or a regal provided with only one set of pipes; and in Melrose
Abbey the figure of an angel holding in his arms a double regal,
the pipes of which are in two sets. The regal generally had
keys like those of the organ but smaller. A painting in the
National Gallery, attributed to Melozzo da Forlì (1438-1494)
contains a regal which has keys of a peculiar shape, rather
resembling the pistons of certain brass instruments. (<a href="#fig_1">Fig. 1</a>,
<span class="decoration">Frontispiece</span>.) To avoid misapprehension, it is necessary to
mention that the name <dfn>regal</dfn> (or <dfn>regals</dfn>, <dfn>rigols</dfn>) was also applied
to an instrument of percussion with sonorous slabs of wood.
This contrivance was, in short, a kind of harmonica, resembling
in shape as well as in the principle of its construction the little
glass harmonica, a mere toy, in which slips of glass are arranged
according to our musical scale. In England it appears
to have been still known in the beginning of the eighteenth
century. Grassineau describes the “Rigols” as “a kind of
musical instrument consisting of several sticks bound together,
only separated by beads. It makes a tolerable harmony,
being well struck with a ball at the end of a stick.” In the
earlier centuries of the Middle Ages there appear to have been
some instruments of percussion in favour, to which Grassineau’s
expression “a tolerable harmony” would scarcely
have been applicable. Drums, of course, were known; and
their rhythmical noise must have been soft music, compared
with the shrill sounds of the <dfn>cymbalum</dfn> (a contrivance consisting
of a number of metal plates suspended on cords, so that
they would be clashed together simultaneously) or with the
clangour of the <dfn>cymbalum</dfn> constructed with bells instead of
plates; or with the piercing noise of the <dfn>bunibulum</dfn>, or <dfn>bombulom</dfn>;
an instrument which consisted of an angular frame
to which were loosely attached metal plates of various shapes
and sizes. The lower part of the frame constituted the
<!--Pg 131--><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="pageno">98</span>

<h4 class="h4head">EUROPEAN INSTRUMENTS OF THE MIDDLE AGES.</h4>
<p class="center">(<span class="decoration">Continued</span>).</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Respecting</span> the orchestras, or musical bands, represented
on monuments of the Middle Ages, there can hardly be a doubt
that the artists who sculptured them were not unfrequently led
by their imagination rather than by an adherence to actual
fact. It is, however, not likely that they introduced into such
representations instruments that were never admitted in the
orchestras, and which would have appeared inappropriate to
the contemporaries of the artists. An examination of one
or two of the orchestras may therefore find a place here,
especially as they throw some additional light upon the characteristics
of the instrumental music of mediæval time.</p>

<p>A very interesting group of music performers, dating, it is
said, from the end of the eleventh century, is preserved in a
bas-relief which formerly ornamented the abbey of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Georges
de Boscherville and which is now removed to the museum
of Rouen (<a href="#fig_35">Fig. 35</a>). The orchestra comprises twelve performers,
most of whom wear a crown. The first of them
plays upon a viol, which he holds between his knees as
the violoncello is held. His instrument is scarcely as large as
the smallest viola da gamba. By his side are a royal lady and
her attendant, the former playing on an <dfn>organistrum</dfn> of which
the latter is turning the wheel. Next to these is represented
a performer on a <dfn>syrinx</dfn>; and next to him a performer on a
stringed instrument resembling a lute, which, however, is too
much dilapidated to be recognisable. Then we have a musician
<!--Pg 135--><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pageno">100</span>
with a small stringed instrument resembling the <dfn>nablum</dfn> (<span class="decoration">see</span>
<a href="#Page_86">p. 86</a>). The next musician, also represented as a royal personage,
plays on a small species of harp. Then follows a
crowned musician playing the <dfn>viol</dfn> which he holds in almost
precisely the same manner as the violin is held. Again,
another, likewise crowned, plays upon a harp, using with the
right hand a plectrum and with the left hand merely his
fingers. The last two performers, apparently a gentleman and
a gentlewoman, are engaged in striking the <dfn>tintinnabulum</dfn>&mdash;&#8203;a
set of bells in a frame.</p>

<p>In this group of crowned minstrels the sculptor has introduced
a tumbler standing on his head, perhaps the vocalist
of the company, as he has no instrument to play upon. Possibly
the sculptor desired to symbolise the hilarious effects
which music is capable of producing, as well as its elevating
influence upon the devotional feelings.</p>

<p>The two positions in which we find the <dfn>viol</dfn> held is worthy
of notice, inasmuch as it refers the inquirer further back than
might be expected for the origin of our peculiar method of
holding the violin, and the violoncello, in playing. There
were several kinds of the <dfn>viol</dfn> in use, differing in size and in
compass of sound. The most common number of strings
was five, and it was tuned in various ways. One kind had
a string tuned to the note <sub><img src="images/m100a.jpg" width="15%" alt="music snippet" /></sub> running at the side
of the finger-board instead of over it; this string was,
therefore, only capable of producing a single tone. The four
other strings were tuned thus: <sub><img src="images/m100b.jpg" width="25%" alt="music snippet" /></sub> Two
other species, on which all the strings were placed over the
finger-board, were tuned: <sub><img src="images/m100c.jpg" width="25%" alt="music snippet" /></sub> and:
<sub><img src="images/m101.jpg" width="25%" alt="music snippet" /></sub> A very beautiful <dfn>vielle</dfn> is represented
in <a href="#fig_36">Fig. 36</a>. It is of French workmanship of about
1550, with monograms of Henri <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, and is preserved in the
Museum.</p>

<p>The contrivance of placing a string or two at the side of the
finger-board is evidently very old, and was also gradually
adopted on other instruments of the violin class of a somewhat
later period than that of the <dfn>vielle</dfn>; for instance, on the <dfn>lira
di braccio</dfn> of the Italians. It was likewise adopted on the lute,
to obtain a fuller power in the bass; and hence arose the
<dfn>theorbo</dfn>, the <dfn>archlute</dfn>, and other varieties of the old lute.</p>

<p>A grand assemblage of musical performers is represented on
the Portico della Gloria of the famous pilgrimage church of
Santiago de Compostella, in Spain. This triple portal, which
is stated by an inscription on the lintel to have been executed
in the year 1188, consists of a large semi-circular arch with a
smaller arch on either side. The central arch is filled by a
tympanum, round which are twenty-four life-sized seated
figures, in high relief, representing the twenty-four elders seen
by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John in the Apocalypse, each with an instrument of
music. These instruments are carefully represented, and are
of great interest as showing those in use in Spain about the
twelfth century. A cast of this sculpture is in the Museum
(<a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37</a>).</p>

<p>In examining the group of musicians on this sculpture the
reader will probably recognise several instruments in their
hands which are identical with those already described in the
preceding pages. The <dfn>organistrum</dfn>, played by two persons, is
placed in the centre of the group, perhaps owing to its being the
largest of the instruments rather than that it was distinguished
by any superiority in sound or musical effect. Besides the
small harp seen in the hands of the eighth and nineteenth
<!--Pg 141--><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pageno">102</span>
musicians (in form nearly identical with the Anglo-Saxon
harp) we find a small triangular harp, without a front-pillar,
held on the lap by the fifth and eighteenth musicians. The
<dfn>salterio</dfn> on the lap of the tenth and seventeenth musicians
resembles the dulcimer, but seems to be played with the
fingers instead of with hammers. The most interesting instrument
in this orchestra is the <dfn>vihuela</dfn>, or Spanish viol, of the
twelfth century. The first, second, third, sixth, seventh,
ninth, twentieth, twenty-second, twenty-third, and twenty-fourth
musicians are depicted with a <dfn>vihuela</dfn> which bears a
close resemblance to the <dfn>rebec</dfn>. The instrument is represented
with three strings, although in one or two instances five tuning-pegs
are indicated. A large species of <dfn>vihuela</dfn> is given to the
eleventh, fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth musicians.
This instrument differs from the <dfn>rebec</dfn> in so far as its body is
broader and has incurvations at the sides. Also the sound-holes
are different in form and position. The bow does not
occur with any of these viols. But, as will be observed, the
musicians are not represented in the act of playing; they are
tuning and preparing for the performance, and the second of
them is adjusting the bridge of his instrument.</p>

<p>The minstrel gallery of Exeter Cathedral (<a href="#fig_38">Fig. 38</a>) dates
from the fourteenth century. The front is divided into twelve
niches, each of which contains a winged figure or an angel
playing on an instrument of music. There is a cast also of
this famous sculpture at South Kensington. The instruments
are so much dilapidated that some of them cannot be
clearly recognised; but, as far as may be ascertained, they
appear to be as follows:&mdash;&#8203;(1) The <dfn>lute</dfn> or possibly <dfn>cittern</dfn>;
(2) the <dfn>bagpipe</dfn>; (3) the <dfn>clarion</dfn> or the <dfn>shalm</dfn>; (4) the <dfn>rebec</dfn>;
(5) the <dfn>psaltery</dfn> or the <dfn>harp</dfn>; (6) the <dfn>jew’s harp</dfn> (?); (7) the
<dfn>sackbut</dfn> or the <dfn>clarion</dfn>; (8) the <dfn>regals</dfn>; (9) the <dfn>gittern</dfn>, a small
guitar strung with catgut; (10) the <dfn>shalm</dfn> (?); (11) the <dfn>timbrel</dfn>,
<!--Pg 144--><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pageno">103</span>
resembling our present tambourine, with a double row of
gingles; (12) <dfn>cymbals</dfn>. Most of these instruments have been
already noticed in the preceding pages. The <dfn>shalm</dfn>, or <dfn>shawm</dfn>,
was a pipe with a reed in the mouth-hole. The <dfn>wait</dfn> was an
English wind instrument of the same construction. If it
differed in any respect from the <dfn>shalm</dfn>, the difference consisted
probably in the size only. The <dfn>wait</dfn> obtained its name
from being used principally by watchmen, or <dfn>waights</dfn>, to
proclaim the time of night. Such were the poor ancestors of
our fine oboe and clarinet.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">POST-MEDIÆVAL INSTRUMENTS.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Attention</span> must now be drawn to some instruments which
originated during the Middle Ages, but which attained their
highest popularity at a somewhat later period.</p>

<p>About 300 years ago the <dfn>lute</dfn> (<a href="#fig_39">Fig. 39</a>) was almost as popular
as is the pianoforte at the present day. Originally it had
eight thin catgut strings arranged in four pairs, each pair
being tuned in unison; so that its open strings produced four
tones; but in the course of time more strings were added.
Until the sixteenth century twelve was the largest number, or
rather, six pairs. Eleven appears for some centuries to have
been the most usual number of strings; these produced six
tones, since they were arranged in five pairs and a single
string. The latter, called the <dfn>chanterelle</dfn>, was the highest.
According to Thomas Mace, the English lute in common use
during the seventeenth century had twenty-four strings,
arranged in twelve pairs, of which six pairs ran over the
finger-board and the other six by the side of it. This lute
was therefore, more properly speaking, a theorbo. The neck
of the lute, and also of the theorbo, had frets consisting of
catgut strings tightly fastened round it at the proper distances
required for ensuring a chromatic succession of intervals.
The illustration (<a href="#fig_40">Fig. 40</a>) represents a lute-player of the late
fifteenth century. The order of tones adopted for the open
strings varied in different centuries and countries; and this
was also the case with the notation of lute music. The most
common practice was to write the music on six lines, the
upper line representing the first string; the second line, the
second string, etc., and to mark with letters on the lines the
frets at which the fingers ought to be placed&mdash;&#8203;<span class="decoration">a</span> indicating
the open string, <span class="decoration">b</span> the first fret, <span class="decoration">c</span> the second fret, and so on.</p>

<p>The lute was made of various sizes, according to the purpose
for which it was intended in performance. The treble-lute
was of the smallest dimensions, and the bass-lute of the largest.
The <dfn>theorbo</dfn>, or double-necked lute which appears to have
come into use during the sixteenth century, had in addition
to the strings situated over the finger-board a number of others
running at the left side of the finger-board which could not
be shortened by the fingers, and which produced the bass tones.</p>

<p>The <dfn>archlute</dfn> is a large theorbo with a peculiar arrangement
of the strings (<a href="#fig_41">Fig. 41</a>). Several of them were doubled, the
additional string being tuned an octave higher than the other.
The process of tuning such instruments was evidently troublesome
and tedious. Mattheson, the quaint contemporary of
Handel, in his “Das Neu-eröffnete Orchestre,” Hamburg, 1713,
remarks:&mdash;&#8203;"If a lutenist attains the age of eighty, you may
be sure he has tuned sixty years; and the worst of it is that
among a hundred players, especially of the amateurs, scarcely
two are capable of tuning with accuracy. Now there is
something amiss with the strings; now with the frets; and
now again with the screws; so that I have been told that in
Paris it costs as much money to keep a lute as to keep a
horse.” Also Mace, an enthusiastic admirer of the lute,
testifies to the difficulty of keeping the instrument in proper
condition; for his treatise on the lute and theorbo (contained
in “Musick’s Monument,” London, 1676) is replete with
rules for stringing, tuning, cleaning, repairing, etc. And, as
regards preserving the instrument, he gives the advice&mdash;&#8203;"You
shall do well, ever when you lay it by in the day-time,
to put it into a bed that is constantly used, between the rug
and blanket.”
<!--Pg 153--><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pageno">106</span></p>

<p>The <dfn>chitarrone</dfn> is a theorbo with an extraordinarily long
neck, by which the length of the eight bass strings is considerably
increased (<a href="#fig_42">Fig. 42</a>). The largest instruments of this kind
were made some centuries ago, in Rome. They were used in
the theatre for accompanying the voice, before the Clavicembalo,
or Harpsichord, was introduced for this purpose. The
finest instruments of the lute kind were made in Italy, especially
at Bologna, Rome, Venice, and Padua. Many of the
manufacturers in Italy were, however, foreigners. Evelyn,
in his Diary (May 21, 1645), speaking of Bologna, says,
“This place has also been celebrated for lutes made by the
old masters, Mollen [Maler ?], Hans Frey, and Nicholas
Sconvelt, which were of extraordinary price; the workmen
were chiefly Germans.” One of the earliest and most celebrated
of these makers was Lucas Maler (or “Laux Maler”
as he inscribed his name on his instruments). He lived at
Bologna about 1415.

<p>There used to be in Italy various kinds of mandolines, of
which the Milanese and the Neapolitan were the most
common. The first-named had usually ten strings, constituting
five pairs. The Neapolitan <dfn>mandolino</dfn> had eight
strings, constituting four pairs. The strings were usually
twanged with a quill. Mozart, in his “Don Giovanni,” has
made use of the Neapolitan <dfn>mandolino</dfn> in the serenade; but,
as the instrument has fallen into disuse, at least in most
<!--Pg 157--><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="pageno">108</span>
countries except Italy, the part written for it by Mozart is
now generally played on the violin, <dfn>pizzicato</dfn>. The <dfn>mandolino</dfn>
is now often strung with catgut strings. It resembles a
diminutive lute; but its fingerboard has metal frets, and its
strings are fastened to little ivory pins at the end of the
body, instead of being looped through holes in the bridge.
The convex back of the mandoline is deeper than that of
the lute. It is one of the handsomest musical instruments.</p>

<p>Besides the mandoline the Italians had various instruments
in shape resembling the lute. Of this description are, for
instance, the <dfn>mandora</dfn>, <dfn>mandorina</dfn>, and the <dfn>pandurina</dfn>. The
mandoline differs from the pandurina chiefly in having a
rounder and deeper body, and in having the tuning-pegs
placed at the back of the head; while the <dfn>pandurina</dfn> has a
sort of scroll, with the tuning-pegs situated sideways, similar
to the old English cither (<a href="#fig_43">Fig. 43</a>). The <dfn>mandora</dfn> had usually for
each tone two strings, which were of catgut and wire; and there
were eight pairs of them. The <dfn>mandorina</dfn> had four wire strings.</p>

<p>The <dfn>guitar</dfn> (<a href="#fig_44">Fig. 44</a>) is evidently an importation from the East,
but it has undergone various modifications since its adoption
by European nations. It was an instrument of the Moors in
Spain, and became known in France about the 11th century.
The French called it formerly <dfn>guiterne</dfn>, and the English
<dfn>gittern</dfn>, <dfn>ghittern</dfn>, and <dfn>gythorn</dfn>. At the time of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>
we find it occasionally called “the Spanish viol.” At an
early period it probably had the oval shape of the <dfn>kuitra</dfn>, still
in use by the Arab musicians in Tunis and Algiers. In Spain
it had formerly also the name of <dfn>vihuela</dfn>.</p>

<p>Instruction books for the old Spanish guitar have been
written by:&mdash;&#8203;Ludovico Milan, Valencia, 1534; Sixtus
Kargel, Mayence, 1569; Joannes Carolus, Lerida, 1626;
Pietro Milioni, Rome, 1638; Lucas Ruiz de Ribayaz, Madrid,
1672, etc. The number of guitar manuals published during
the 18th century is enormous. Germany alone contributed
above fifty.

<p>The guitar was a fashionable instrument in England, played
by ladies, in the time of Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> On the Continent it
generally had ten catgut strings, of which two were always
tuned in unison. At the present day it has six strings, the
two of which are of silk covered with silver wire, and the
others are of catgut.</p>

<p>A species of guitar is the <dfn>quinterna</dfn>, or <dfn>chiterna</dfn>, somewhat
resembling a violin in shape (<a href="#fig_45">Fig. 45</a>). It was used about two
centuries ago, especially in Italy, by the lower orders of
musicians and comedians for accompanying their vocal
performances. It was played with the fingers instead of a
plectrum.</p>

<p>The <dfn>cithern</dfn>, <dfn>cittern</dfn>, or <dfn>cither</dfn> (<a href="#fig_46">Fig. 46</a>), which during the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was a popular instrument
in England, where it was often played in the barbers’ shops,
had four pairs of wire strings.</p>

<p>Its top generally terminated in a grotesquely-carved human
head. The cithers made in England during the eighteenth
century have generally at the top some inlaid ornamentation
in ivory, mother-of-pearl, or fancy wood.</p>

<p>Although not well suited for the performance of harmonious
combinations, since its wire strings are twanged with a quill,
and therefore only such chords can be properly produced as
are on strings following each other in uninterrupted succession,
the cither, nevertheless, possesses considerable charms.</p>

<p>There are several conjectures as to the derivation of the
German name <dfn>zither</dfn> or <dfn>zitter</dfn>. Some suppose it to be from
“<dfn>zittern</dfn>,” on account of the peculiarly trembling sound of the
instrument. During the first centuries of the Christian era
the word <dfn>cythera</dfn> (<dfn>cithara</dfn>) implied almost any stringed instrument,
especially if the strings were twanged with a plectrum,
<!--Pg 167--><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><span class="pageno">110</span>
or with the fingers. It is also noteworthy, though perhaps only
as a singular coincidence, that the Persians and Hindus have
a three-stringed species of <dfn>zither</dfn>, which they call <dfn>sitar</dfn>, from the
Persian word <dfn>si</dfn>, “three,” and <dfn>tar</dfn>, “a string.” The Hindu
<dfn>sitar</dfn> is, however, now usually mounted with five strings.</p>

<p>The <dfn>harp-guitar</dfn> and <dfn>harp-theorbo</dfn> (<a href="#fig_47">Fig. 47</a>) were manufactured
in England with the intention of improving the
sound of the guitar and theorbo by adopting for them the
body of the harp.</p>

<p>There was also another invention of this kind, called the
<dfn>harp-lute</dfn>.</p>

<p>The <dfn>harp-ventura</dfn> (<a href="#fig_48">Fig. 48</a>) was invented at the beginning of
the last century by Signor Angelo Benedetto Ventura, professor
of music, and teacher of the guitar and harp-lute to
the Princess Charlotte of Wales. The example given has a
back of satin wood, and sides of turtle shell; the belly and
pillar are painted and gilt. It has nineteen catgut strings,
six of which are covered with wire.</p>

<p>The <dfn>banduria</dfn> (<a href="#fig_49">Fig. 49</a>) a lyre-shaped guitar, was often
strung with wire instead of catgut, and played with a plectrum
generally made of tortoise-shell. The specimen illustrated is
made of various woods, has three sound-holes, a machine
head, and twelve catgut strings tuned in pairs.</p>

<p>The Spanish peasants call their rustic guitar <dfn>vihuela</dfn>;
and it appears probable that the “gittrons that are called
Spanish vialls,” mentioned in the list of musical instruments
of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> (Harl. <abbr title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr> 1419, p. 202) were small guitars
of this description.</p>

<p>The Irish harp (<dfn>clarseth</dfn>) illustrated in <a href="#fig_50">Fig. 50</a>, belonged
formerly to a celebrated Irish harper. A similar one, which is in
the possession of the Marquess of Kildare, bears the date 1671.</p>

<p>Considering the scarcity of the old Irish <dfn>clarseth</dfn>, mention
may be made of a fine specimen formerly in the collection of
Irish antiquities belonging to Thomas Crofton Croker, from
which it was purchased, in the year 1854, at an auction in
London, by Thomas Bateman, Esq. It bears on its front the
inscription, <cite>Made by John Kelly for the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Charles Bunworth
Baltdaniel, 1734</cite>. At the contentions or meetings of the
bards of Ireland, between the years 1730 and 1750, which were
generally held at Bruree, county Limerick, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Charles
Bunworth was five times chosen umpire, or president. Although
this harp is not of high antiquity, it is an interesting
example of the ancient form and construction, and likewise of
the ancient manner of ornamenting the instrument. A wood
engraving of it, from a drawing by Maclise, is given in “A
Descriptive Catalogue of the Antiquities and Miscellaneous
Objects preserved in the Museum of Thomas Bateman, at
Lomberdale House, Derbyshire,” Bakewell, 1855. An account
of the Irish harps deposited in the Museum of Dublin is
to be found in “A Descriptive Catalogue of the Antiquities in
the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy,” by W. R. Wilde,
Dublin, 1863. The illustrations of the Irish harp in the works
of Bunting and similar writers may be supposed to be known
to musicians.</p>

<p>The number of strings appears to have been greater on the
older specimens recorded than on the later ones. Prætorius,
in his “Syntagma musicum,” etc., <abbr title="volume two">vol. ii.</abbr>, Wolfenbüttel,
1619, gives an illustration of the Irish harp, in which it is
represented with forty-three strings. He describes the
instrument as having a pleasant resonance, and being constructed
with a considerable degree of ingenuity. The
illustration exhibits the same shape, with the fore-bar bent
outwards, which is shown in the present specimen.</p>

<p>Some harps after the model of the old Irish <dfn>clarseth</dfn>, which
are painted and gilt, were made in Dublin in the beginning of
the last century.</p>

<p><!--Pg 177--><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><span class="pageno">112</span>
The small harp of the middle ages of Central and Western
Europe, depicted in old sculptures and paintings, generally
exhibits the front-bar of its frame somewhat bent outwardly,
much as is the case with the Irish <dfn>clarseth</dfn>. Gradually the
number of its strings was increased; and, likewise the strength
of the frame for resisting the tension of the strings. The
front-bar of our harp is straight, or a front-pillar. Until the
seventeenth century only the diatonic series of intervals was
properly obtainable on the instrument. The performer had,
however, a method of producing occasionally a semitone by
pressing the finger against the string towards the end, much in
the same manner in which the Burmese produce chromatic
intervals on the <dfn>soung</dfn>. Towards the end of the seventeenth
century the Tyrolian harp makers adopted little plates with
hooks, which could be moved so as to press upon the strings,
and thereby shorten them, for the production of the semitones,
more rapidly and unerringly than could be done by the fingers.
A French harp of the period of Louis <abbr title="Sixteen">XVI.</abbr>. is illustrated
(<a href="#fig_51">Fig. 51</a>). It is carved and gilt in the style of Gouthière,
and decorated with oak foliage and acorns; at the top of
the pillar is a figure of a Cupid.</p>

<p>Students who examine the old instruments above described
will probably wish to know something about their quality
of tone. “How do they sound? Might they still be made
effective in our present state of the art?” are questions which
naturally occur to the musical inquirer having such instruments
brought before him. A few words bearing on these
questions may therefore not be out of place here.</p>

<p>It is generally and justly admitted that in no other branch
of the art of music has greater progress been made during the
last century than in the construction of musical instruments.
Nevertheless, there are people who think that we have also
lost something here which might with advantage be restored.
Our various instruments by being more and more perfected
are becoming too much alike in quality of sound, or in that
character of tone which the French call <dfn>timbre</dfn>, and the
Germans <dfn>Klangfarbe</dfn>, and which professor Tyndall in his
lectures on sound has translated <dfn>clang-tint</dfn>. Every
musical composer knows how much more suitable one <dfn>clang-tint</dfn>
is for the expression of a certain emotion than another.
Our old instruments, imperfect though they were in many
respects, possessed this variety of <dfn>clang-tint</dfn> to a high degree.
Neither were they on this account less capable of expression
than the modern ones. That no improvement has been made
during the last two centuries in instruments of the violin
class is a well-known fact. As to lutes and cithers the collection
at South Kensington contains specimens so rich and
mellow in tone as to cause musicians to regret that these
instruments have entirely fallen into oblivion.</p>

<p>As regards beauty of appearance our earlier instruments
were certainly superior to the modern. Indeed, we have now
scarcely a musical instrument which can be called beautiful.
The old lutes, cithers, viols, dulcimers, etc., are not only
elegant in shape but are also often tastefully ornamented
with carvings, designs in marquetry, and painting.</p>

<p>Of the stringed instruments used in our orchestra, the
<dfn>violin</dfn> (<a href="#fig_52">Fig. 52</a>) is the one which has been longest preserved
entirely unaltered. Its name (Italian, <dfn>violino</dfn>), a diminutive
of <dfn>viola</dfn>, suggests that our <dfn>tenor</dfn> (<dfn>viola di braccio</dfn>) is the older instrument
of the two. The <dfn>viol</dfn> (<a href="#fig_53">Fig. 53</a>, facing p. 104) in use about
three centuries ago, was however somewhat different in shape.
As the oldest-known instruments played with a bow, which in
European countries preceded the violin, may be mentioned:&mdash;&#8203;The
<dfn>rebec</dfn>, which, it appears, was first popular in Spain;
the <dfn>crwth</dfn> of the Welsh; the <dfn>fidla</dfn> of the Norwegian, which, in
<!--Pg 183--><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pageno">114</span>
shape somewhat resembled the <dfn>crwth</dfn>, and which, with some
slight modifications, is still occasionally to be found in Iceland,
where it is called <dfn>langspiel</dfn>; and the <dfn>fithele</dfn> of the Anglo-Saxons.</p>

<p>Such were the instruments from which our violin has
gradually been developed, until it attained, in the seventeenth
century, that degree of perfection which has never since been
surpassed. The violin makers whose instruments are still
most highly valued are:&mdash;&#8203;Antonio Amati, whose most
flourishing period dates between the years 1592 and 1619;
Nicolo Amati, the nephew of the preceding, 1662-1692;
Giuseppe Guarneri, 1690-1707; Antonio Stradivari, 1700-1725;
and Jakob Stainer, 1650-1670. All these celebrated
makers, except Jakob Stainer, were Italians, living at
Cremona. Jakob Stainer (or Jacobus Steiner) was a native
of Absam, a village near Innsbruck in the Tyrol. Few
musical instruments have experienced so great an increase
in price as the violins of these celebrated makers. Stainer
used himself to carry his violins to the monasteries situated
in the neighbourhood of Absam, where he lived. He sold
them at 40 florins apiece. It was not until after his death that
his workmanship was duly appreciated.</p>

<p>The <dfn>viola da gamba</dfn> (French, <dfn>basse de viole</dfn>; German, <dfn>Kniegeige</dfn>)
derives its name from its being held between the knees
of the performer (<a href="#fig_54">Figs. 54</a> and <a href="#fig_55">55</a>). It was the predecessor
of the violoncello, and was made with frets. It was a favourite
instrument in England at the time of Queen Elizabeth, and
even ladies played it occasionally. In England it was called
<dfn>base viol</dfn>, and also <dfn>viol-de-gambo</dfn>. Sir Toby Belch, in Shakespeare’s
“Twelfth Night,” says of Sir Andrew Aguecheek:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"He plays o’ the viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or
four languages word for word without book, and hath all
the good gifts of nature."</p>

<p>Among the English public performers on the <dfn>viola da
gamba</dfn> are recorded a Mrs. Sarah Ottey, in the year 1723,
and a Miss Ford in 1760. Carl Friedrich Abel, a German,
who lived in London during the latter half of the eighteenth
century, was the last performer of celebrity on this instrument.
Johann Sebastian Bach has employed it in his
admirable “Passionsmusik des Matthæus"; and there are
some fine “Suites,” still occasionally to be met with, composed
for it by M. de Caix d’Herveloix, published in the year 1710.
The tone of the <dfn>viola da gamba</dfn> is rather nasal, but sweet and
expressive; indeed, it is to be regretted that this charming
instrument has fallen into disuse. There is, however, a
<dfn>gamba</dfn> stop in the organ, which resembles the famous <dfn>vox
humana</dfn> stop, and which has recently been much favoured
by organ builders.</p>

<p>The <dfn>violoncello</dfn> came into competition with the <dfn>viola da
gamba</dfn> at the beginning of the eighteenth century, and has
now entirely superseded its predecessor.</p>

<p>A <dfn>viola di bardone</dfn> in the Museum (<a href="#fig_56">Fig. 56</a>) has a neck of
carved and pierced box-wood, terminating in a figure of
Apollo playing the lyre; the principal finger-board is of ivory,
engraved and inlaid with ebony and tortoiseshell, with figures
of Jupiter and Juno, and a lady playing a lute; the second
finger-board is also of pierced and engraved ivory. The
instrument has four catgut and fourteen metal sympathetic
strings, and a double wrest. It was made by Jaques Sainprae,
of Berlin, and is said to have belonged to Quanz, music master
of Frederick the Great.</p>

<p>The most accomplished performers on the <dfn>viola di bardone</dfn>
were Anton Lidl of Vienna (to whom is sometimes erroneously
ascribed the invention of this instrument) and Karl Franz, a
musician of the band of Prince Esterhazy, about the middle
of the 18th century. Lidl played on the <dfn>viola di bardone</dfn> in
<!--Pg 191--><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><span class="pageno">116</span>
concerts in England during the year 1776. Joachim Tielke
of Hamburg, the manufacturer of a specimen in the Museum,
was an instrument maker whose lutes were much esteemed
on account of their fine tone, and their elegant ornamentation.
He made them of ebony inlaid with ivory, mother-of-pearl,
silver, and gold.</p>

<p>Joseph Haydn wrote sixty-three compositions for the
<dfn>viola di bardone</dfn> by order of Prince Esterhazy, who was himself
a performer on this instrument, and who admired it greatly.
Its tone is soft and very expressive, but rather tremulous;
owing to this quality, probably, it was also called <dfn>viola di
fagotto</dfn>. It never became very popular, since its rather
complicated construction offered too many difficulties in its
treatment. In Germany it was generally called <dfn>Baryton</dfn>.</p>

<p>The <dfn>viola d’amore</dfn> (<a href="#fig_57">Fig. 57</a>) was often strung entirely with
wire. It appears to have been a novelty to Evelyn, for he
records in his Diary of November 20th, 1679, “I dined
with Mr. Slingsby, Master of the Mint, with my wife, invited
to hear music, which was exquisitely performed by four of the
most renowned masters: Du Prue, a Frenchman, on the lute;
Signor Bartholomeo, an Italian, on the harpsichord; Nicholao,
on the violin; but above all, for its sweetness and novelty,
the <dfn>viol d’amore</dfn> of five wire strings played on with a bow,
being but an ordinary violin played on lyre-way by a German.”
Mattheson ("Das Neu-Eröffnete Orchestre,” Hamburg,
1713) describes the <dfn>viola d’amore</dfn> as being mounted with four
wire strings, and with one catgut string for the highest tone.</p>

<p>He praises its sweetness of sound, but does not mention the
sympathetic strings. The transformation of the wire-strung
<dfn>viola d’amore</dfn> into the so-called psaltery or sultana, which has
no sympathetic strings, is indicated in the following statement
by Sir John Graham Dalyell ("Musical Memoirs of Scotland,”
Edinburgh, 1849), “The instrument was first introduced in
public in London during the year 1715, when it was heard
between the acts of an opera. It was known in Scotland
in the middle of the century, and a taste for it was probably
encouraged by the performance of Passerini, an Italian
resident in Edinburgh, in the year 1752, when it was said
to be a new instrument called <dfn>viole d’amour</dfn>. Passerini was
manager of the Gentleman’s and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cecilia Concert, where
he and his wife had a permanent engagement as skilled
musicians. He played solos and accompanied singing with
the instrument. Perhaps the <dfn>viole d’amour</dfn> underwent
several modifications, as its name was changed to <dfn>psaltery</dfn>,
in the belief of its being the ancient instrument so denominated,
which is quite different according to most authorities, not
belonging to the fidicinal tribe. In 1754 a concert for the new
instrument called the <dfn>psaltery</dfn> was announced for Signor
Carusi’s benefit concert in Edinburgh, and performed by
Pasquali, another Italian musician, also resident there.
From its soft and simple nature it was eulogised in 1762 as
unequalled for delicacy and sweetness. I knew a lady many
years ago in Edinburgh who played melodies with great
delicacy on this instrument, which was strung with wire, and
had frets on the finger-board.” From these accounts it would
appear that the <dfn>viola d’amore</dfn> strung entirely with wire was
not much used in England before the year 1700, although
it evidently existed in this country in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The <dfn>double-bass</dfn> (Italian, <dfn>contrebasso</dfn>, <dfn>violone</dfn>; French,
<dfn>contrebasse</dfn>; German, <dfn>grosse Bassgeige</dfn>, <dfn>Kontrabass</dfn>) is either
four-stringed or three-stringed. A three-stringed example
known as “The Giant” presented by Dragonetti to the

<p>Dragonetti, the celebrated <dfn>virtuoso</dfn> on the double-bass,
came to England in the year 1794. His favourite instrument,
<!--Pg 197--><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span class="pageno">118</span>
upon which he played in public concerts, was a “Gaspar
di Salo,” which he obtained from the Convent of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pietro at
Vicenza, and which he never could be induced to part with,
although £800, it is said, was offered him for it by one of
his rich and enthusiastic pupils in England. After the death
of Dragonetti this bass, and another valuable one by Stradivarius,
were sent back to Italy, he having bequeathed them
in his will to the town of Venice. Dragonetti died in the
year 1846 at his house in Leicester Square, at the age of
eighty-three. A year before his death he was still able to
assist in the public performances at the Beethoven Festival in
Bonn. His friend H. Philipps mentions in his “Musical
Recollections” that the ends of Dragonetti’s fingers had
gradually become quite flat and deformed from playing.</p>

<p>Some double-basses of extraordinarily large size are known
to have been made in England. William Gardiner ("Music
and Friends,” London, 1838, p. 70) mentions such an instrument,
made by Martin in Leicester, which he saw in the year
1786, and which, if his statement may be relied upon, “was of
such height that Mr. Martin was obliged to cut a hole in the
ceiling to let the head through; so that it was tuned by going
upstairs into the room above."</p>

<p>A <dfn>sordino</dfn> (French, <dfn>pochette</dfn>; German, <dfn>Taschengeige</dfn>) is
illustrated in <a href="#fig_59">Fig. 59</a>. About 300 years ago the <dfn>sordino</dfn> was
kept by gentlemen in a case resembling a pen case, which
they put in the pocket when they went to a singing party; and
they used the instrument for insuring correct intonation while
singing madrigals and catches. Kircher, in his “Musurgia
Universalis,” Romæ, 1650, calls it <dfn>linterculus</dfn>, no doubt from
its resemblance to a small boat.</p>

<p>At the present day the people twang the bûche with a
quill; but in olden time it was played thus:&mdash;&#8203;The performer,
having placed the instrument on a table, twanged the strings
with the thumb of his right hand, while he used his left hand
in pressing down, by means of a little stick, those strings
which are placed over the frets, and which, being tuned in
unison, serve for producing the melody. The other strings,
tuned a <dfn>fifth</dfn> lower, were occasionally struck as an accompaniment.</p>

<p>Primitive in construction, and imperfect for our present
musical performances as the <dfn>Scheitholz</dfn> is, it nevertheless is
interesting, not only on account of its popularity three centuries
ago, but also because it is the prototype of the horizontal
cither, which has come somewhat into vogue in the last
century.</p>

<p>The most popular instruments played with a bow, in the
seventeenth century, were the <dfn>treble-viol</dfn>, the <dfn>tenor-viol</dfn>, and
the <dfn>bass-viol</dfn>. It was usual for viol players to have “a chest
of viols,” a case containing four or more viols, of different
sizes. Thus, Thomas Mace in his directions for the use of
the viol, “Musick’s Monument” 1676, remarks, “Your best
provision, and most complete, will be a good chest of viols,
six in number, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, two basses, two tenors, and two trebles,
all truly and proportionately suited.” The violist, to be
properly furnished with his requirements, had therefore to
supply himself with a larger stock of instruments than the
violinist of the present day.</p>

<p>The <dfn>virginal</dfn> (<a href="#fig_61">Figs. 61</a> and <a href="#fig_62">62</a>) is said to have obtained
its name from having been intended especially to be
played by young ladies. The statement of some writers
that it was called virginal in compliment to Queen Elizabeth,
is refuted by the fact of its being mentioned among
the musical instruments of King Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>, in the
<!--Pg 205--><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="pageno">120</span>
beginning of the sixteenth century. Probably the name
was originally given to it in honour of the Virgin Mary,
since the <dfn>virginal</dfn> was used by the nuns for accompanying
their hymns addressed to the Holy Virgin. It was made
of various sizes, but generally small in comparison with our
square pianoforte. The Italians, about three hundred years
ago, constructed a small portable instrument of this kind,
which they called <dfn>ottavino</dfn> (or <dfn>octavina</dfn>) because its pitch was
an octave higher than that of the clavicembalo, or harpsichord.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth was a performer on the <dfn>virginal</dfn> (<span class="decoration">see</span> <a href="#fig_61">Fig. 61</a>)
as well as on the lute. Sir James Melville, the Scotch ambassador,
records in his memoirs an interview with Queen Elizabeth,
in the year 1564, in which he heard her play upon the virginal:&mdash;&#8203;"Then
sche asked wither the Quen (Mary of Scotland)
or sche played best. In that I gaif hir the prayse.” During
the Shakesperian age a virginal generally stood in the barbers’
shops for the amusement of the customers. The instrument
had evidently retained its popularity at the time of the Great
Fire of London; for Pepys (Diary, September 2nd, 1666)
records:&mdash;&#8203;"River full of lighters and boats taking in goods,
and good goods swimming in the water; and only I observed
that hardly one lighter or boat in three that had the goods
of a house in, but there was a pair of virginalls in it."</p>

<p>The instrument has metal strings, one for each tone, which
are twanged by means of small portions of quill, attached to
slips of wood called “jacks,” and provided with thin metal
springs. Its construction is therefore similar to that of the
spinet and harpischord. Crowquills were most commonly
used in the construction of such instruments; but other
materials, as for instance leather, whalebone, and even elastic
strips of metal, were occasionally adopted instead.</p>

<p>There evidently prevailed, some centuries ago, much vagueness
in the designation of certain stringed instruments with a
key-board. The term <dfn>clavichord</dfn> seems to have not unfrequently
been applied to any stringed instrument with a key-board,
no matter what its interior construction might be.
Johann Walther, in his “Musicalisches Lexicon,” Leipzig,
1732, describes the <dfn>virginal</dfn> (or “Virginale,” as he calls it),
in these words:-"Ein Clavier vors Frauenzimmer” (<dfn>a
clavichord for ladies</dfn>). The following brief explanation of the
difference between the spinet and the clavichord may therefore
be of interest to some inquirers.</p>

<p>The <dfn>spinet</dfn> (Italian, <dfn>spinetta</dfn> or <dfn>spinetto</dfn>; French, <dfn>épinette</dfn>) is
said to have derived its name from the little quill (<dfn>spina</dfn>) used
in its mechanism, which is the same as that of the harpsichord
and the virginal, described before.</p>

<p>The more commonly-known spinet (<a href="#fig_63">Figs. 63</a> and <a href="#fig_64">64</a>)
resembles in shape the harpsichord and the grand piano.
It is, however, smaller than the harpsichord, and its key-board
is placed in a somewhat oblique direction. The tone
of the spinet was generally a <dfn>fifth</dfn> higher than that of the
harpsichord.</p>

<p>The <dfn>clavichord</dfn> (Italian, <dfn>clavicordo</dfn>; German, <dfn>Clavier</dfn>, or
<dfn>Klavier</dfn>), differs from the spinet inasmuch as it is of an oblong-square
shape (<a href="#fig_65">Fig. 65</a>), and especially in its being constructed
with so-called <dfn>tangents</dfn>, <span class="decoration">i.e.</span>, metal pins which press under the
strings when the keys are struck. The strings are of thin brass
wire. The oldest specimens of the clavichord still extant are
from three to four feet in length, and about two feet in width.
The lower keys are black, and the upper ones are white.
There is only a single string for each tone and its upper semitone;
thus, there is but one string for <span class="decoration">C</span> and <dfn>C-sharp</dfn>, and
likewise for <span class="decoration">D</span> and <dfn>D-sharp</dfn>, and so on. The semitone is produced
by a second tangent, which touches the string at a
place a little distant from that at which it is touched by the
tangent producing the whole-tone. On being pressed under
<!--Pg 211--><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pageno">122</span>
the string, the tangent divides it into two vibrating parts,
one of which is considerably longer than the other and gives
the sound. The other part is too short to be distinctly
audible, and therefore does not very perceptibly interfere
with the clearness of the sound. Moreover, its vibration
is checked by a strip of cloth interlaced with the strings. It
will easily be understood that of the two tangents, the one
which most shortens the sounding part of the string, must
produce a tone of a higher pitch than the other.</p>

<p>Such was the construction of the <dfn>clavichord</dfn> until about the
year 1700, when it was improved in so far as that each key
was supplied with a separate string. The clavichord is pre-eminently
a German instrument. Although now almost entirely
supplanted by the pianoforte, it is still occasionally to be met
with in the house of the German village schoolmaster and of
the country parson. Though but weak in sound, it admits
of much expression; and most of the German classical composers
who lived before the invention of the pianoforte preferred
the clavichord to the harpsichord. In England it has never
become popular. Considering the simplicity of its construction,
it might be surmised that the price of a clavichord
was generally very moderate. In the latter half of the
eighteenth century the prices charged for such instruments by
some of the best manufacturers were as follows:&mdash;&#8203;Carl Lemme,
in Brunswick, made clavichords of various qualities, which
fetched from three to twelve Louis d’ors a-piece; he also made,
for exportation to Batavia, clavichords with a compressed
sounding-board, invented by his father in the year 1771;
Krämer, in Göttingen, charged from four to fourteen Louis
d’ors, according to size and finish; and Wilhelmi, in Cassel,
charged from twenty to fifty thalers,&mdash;&#8203;from about £3 to £7 10s.</p>

<p>The <dfn>clavicembalo</dfn> (often designated merely <dfn>cembalo</dfn>) is called
in German “Flügel,” on account of its shape somewhat
resembling the wing of a bird. <dfn>Clavicembali</dfn> formerly in use
generally had a compass of five octaves. The instrument
was usually supplied with some stops by means of which
the quality of sound could in some measure be modified.
Furthermore, it was frequently made with two keyboards,
one for the loud and another for the soft tones. The harpsichord
made in England was precisely of the same construction.
In fact, the best harpsichord makers in England were emigrants
from the continent, and the founders of some of the great
pianoforte manufactories still flourishing in London. Burkhardt
Tschudi, for instance, a harpsichord maker from Switzerland,
was the founder of Broadwood’s celebrated manufactory,
which dates from the year 1732. Kirkman, a German (who,
before he established himself in England, wrote his name
Kirchmann) sold his harpsichords in London, according
to the German Musical Almanac for the year 1782, at the
price of from 60<abbr title="pounds" class="decoration">l.</abbr> to 90<abbr title="pounds" class="decoration">l.</abbr> apiece. In the beginning of the
eighteenth century many of the harpsichords made in England
had, according to Grassineau (Musical Dictionary, London,
1740), a compass of only four octaves.</p>

<p>However, already as early as in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, harpsichords or clavicembali, of a superior
quality, manufactured by Hans Ruckers and his sons Jean
and Andreas, were imported into England. The instruments
of these celebrated Antwerp manufacturers were tastefully
embellished, and the best Dutch painters not infrequently
enriched them with devices. The consequence has been
that after the invention of the pianoforte, many of these
old harpsichords were taken to pieces in order to preserve the
valuable panels. The price of a fine harpsichord by Ruckers
about 1770, was £120.</p>

<p>The old <dfn>clavicembalo</dfn> by Antonio Baffo, of Venice (<a href="#fig_66">Fig. 66</a>),
has slips of prepared leather instead of the usual crowquills,
<!--Pg 215--><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pageno">124</span>
which, if original, would show that the statement of some
writers as to Pascal Taskin in Paris being the first to use
leather is erroneous. Taskin, in constructing in the year
1768 the <dfn>Clavecin à peau de buffle</dfn>, may have revived an old
invention, which, however, he seems to have much improved.
He made a <dfn>clavecin</dfn> with three keyboards, two of which were
connected with actions constructed of crowquills, and the
third with an action of leather. The modification in quality
of sound thereby obtained was greatly admired.</p>

<p>The illustration (<a href="#fig_67">Fig. 67</a>) represents a clavecin made by
Pascal Taskin in the year 1786. The case is highly ornamented
with Japanese figures and gilding.</p>

<p>The invention of the <dfn>clavicembalo</dfn> as well as of the <dfn>clavicordo</dfn>,
is by some old writers ascribed to Guido Aretinus (or Guido
d’Arezzo), the famous monk who is recorded to have invented,
in the year 1025, the Solmisation, and also to have first
conceived the idea of employing lines and dots in the notation
of musical sounds. Unauthentic though the tradition may
be which assigns to Guido the invention of the stringed
instruments with a keyboard, it appears very probable that
some rude kind of clavichord was first constructed about
his time, or soon after.</p>

<p>The <dfn>claviorganum</dfn>, or organ-harpsichord, consists of an
organ and a harpsichord (or a spinet) combined. Either can
be played separately or with the other together. The separation
and the union are effected by means of a stop or a pedal.
The claviorganum was, some centuries ago, not uncommon.
It enables the performer to sustain the sound at pleasure,
which on the harpsichord is as little possible as on the pianoforte.
A <dfn>claviorganum</dfn> from Ightham Mote, near Sevenoaks,
illustrated in <a href="#fig_68">Fig. 68</a>, affords evidence of a higher antiquity
of instruments of this kind than might perhaps be expected.
It bears the inscription, <dfn>Lodowicus Theewes me fecit</dfn>, 1579.
There is scarcely more remaining of this interesting relic than
the outer case; but this is so elaborately finished that, if
the mechanism was constructed with equal care and success,
it must have been a superior instrument. The maker is
unknown in musical history. Perhaps he belonged to the
family of Treu (also written Trew), musicians of repute in
Anspach about the year 1600.</p>

<p>The pianoforte, which now has entirely superseded the
harpsichord, was first constructed at the beginning of the
eighteenth century, in Italy and Germany. About the
year 1767 it was from Germany introduced into England;
but the English musicians for a considerable period objected
to it, and preferred to retain the harpsichord.</p>

<p>That there was, in the time of Shakespeare, a species of
flageolet, called <dfn>recorder</dfn>, is undoubtedly known to most
readers from the stage direction in Hamlet: <span class="decoration">Re-enter players
with recorders</span>. The recorder is also mentioned by Milton, and
described by Bacon, who states that “the figures of recorders,
flutes and pipes are straight; but the recorder hath a less
bore, and a greater above and below.” An illustration of
this old instrument, which has now become very scarce, is
given in “The Genteel Companion; Being exact Directions
for the Recorder: etc.” London, 1683.</p>

<p>The <dfn>flauto dolce</dfn> (French, <dfn>flûte douce</dfn>, and <dfn>flûte à bec</dfn>), much
in use some centuries ago, was made of various lengths (Fig.
70). The Germans called it <dfn>Pflockflöte</dfn>, <span class="decoration">i.e.</span>, a flute with a
plug in the mouth-hole. The most common <dfn>flûte à bec</dfn> was
made with six finger-holes, and its compass embraced somewhat
more than two octaves. Several of the finger-holes
required to be only partly covered in order to produce the
desired tone. There was often a key on this instrument
in addition to the finger-holes. This flute was much in
favour in England; hence it was called in France “Flûte
<!--Pg 221--><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span class="pageno">126</span>
d’Angleterre.” It has gradually been supplanted by the
“Flûte traversière,” or “German Flute."</p>

<p>The <dfn>flageolet</dfn> (<a href="#fig_71">Fig. 71</a>), the smallest <dfn>flûte à bec</dfn>, was formerly
played in England even by ladies. Pepys, in his Diary (March
1st, 1666), records:&mdash;&#8203;"Being returned home, I find Greeting,
the flageolet-master, come, and teaching my wife; and I do
think my wife will take pleasure in it, and it will be easy for
her, and pleasant."</p>

<p>The flageolet was made of various sizes. Pepys (Diary,
January 20th, 1667) records:&mdash;&#8203;"To Drumbleby’s, the pipemaker,
there to advise about the making of a flageolet to go
low and soft; and he do show me a way which do, and
also a fashion of having two pipes of the same note fastened
together, so as I can play on one and then echo it upon the
other, which is mighty pretty."</p>

<p>The <dfn>double flageolet</dfn> was invented by Bainbridge about the
year 1800. The <dfn>triple flageolet</dfn> (<a href="#fig_69">Fig. 69</a>) is less common but
equally useless for musical performances of the present day.
The “Harmonicon,” London, 1830, records:&mdash;&#8203;"Within these
few years Mr. Bainbridge has added a bass joint to his double
flageolet and the tone resembles the lower notes on a German
flute. The effect produced by the combination of three notes
is very good and mellifluous. The bass joint is fixed at the
back of the double flageolet, and the breath is conveyed by
means of a tube; and by the introduction of what are termed
stop-keys, a solo, duet, or trio may be instantaneously performed.
The bass notes are produced by keys pressed with
the thumb of the left hand.” The writer remarks that “this
instrument being purely English, I consider it deserving of
being recorded as a very ingenious invention."</p>

<p>The <dfn>hautboy</dfn> or <dfn>oboe</dfn> (<a href="#fig_72">Fig. 72</a>) came into more general
use about the year 1720.</p>

<p>The most noteworthy kinds of the hautboy of the time of
Handel and Sebastian Bach are,&mdash;&#8203;the <dfn>oboe da caccia</dfn>, which is
identical with the <dfn>corno inglese</dfn> (<dfn>English horn</dfn>, <dfn>cor anglais</dfn>), a
large hautboy still occasionally employed in the orchestra,
and the <dfn>oboe d’amore</dfn>, or <dfn>oboe lungo</dfn>, whch has fallen into
oblivion. The pitch of the <dfn>oboe d’amore</dfn> was a minor third
lower than that of the common hautboy, or <dfn>oboe piccolo</dfn>;
and its sound, owing to the narrowness of the bore at its further
end, was rather weak, but particularly sweet.</p>

<p>The precursor of the hautboy was evidently the <dfn>bombardino</dfn>,
or <dfn>chalumeau</dfn>. The <dfn>bombardino</dfn>, also called in Italian
<dfn>bombardo piccolo</dfn>, was a small <dfn>bombardo</dfn>, an instrument of the
hautboy kind, about three centuries ago much in use on the
Continent.</p>

<p>The Germans called the <dfn>bombardo</dfn> “Pommer,” which
appears to be a corruption of the Italian name. The <dfn>bombardo</dfn>
was made of various sizes, and with a greater or smaller
number of finger-holes and keys. That which produced the
bass tones was sometimes of an enormous length, and was
blown through a bent tube, like the bassoon, the invention
of which it is said to have suggested.</p>

<p>The smallest instrument, called <dfn>chalumeau</dfn> (from <dfn>calamus</dfn>,
“a reed") is still occasionally to be found among the peasantry
in the Tyrol and some other parts of the Continent.
The Germans call it <dfn>Schalmei</dfn>, and the Italians <dfn>piffero pastorale</dfn>.
In England it was formerly called <dfn>shawm</dfn> or <dfn>shalm</dfn>.</p>

<p>The <dfn>clarinet</dfn>, likewise an instrument of this class, is said to
have been invented by Denner, in Nürnberg, about the year
1700. The clarinet has only a single vibrating reed in the
mouth-piece; the hautboy has a double one.</p>

<p>The invention of the <dfn>bassoon</dfn> (Italian, <dfn>fagotto</dfn>; French
<dfn>basson</dfn>; German, <dfn>Fagott</dfn>) is ascribed to Afranio, a canon of
Ferrara, who constructed the first in the year 1539. The
instrument was, however, an improved <dfn>bombardo</dfn> rather than
<!--Pg 225--><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pageno">128</span>
a new invention. As early as the year 1550, the celebrated
wind-instrument maker Schnitzer, in Nürnberg, manufactured
bassoons which were considered as very complete. <a href="#fig_73">Fig. 73</a>
illustrates a species of bassoon bound with brass with brass
keys, and complete with mouth-piece and reed.</p>

<p>Various bassoons of small dimensions in use about two
centuries ago, and earlier (the <dfn>dolciano</dfn>, <dfn>Quartfagott</dfn>, <dfn>Quintfagott</dfn>,
<dfn>tenor-bassoon</dfn>, <dfn>corthol</dfn>, etc.), are now antiquated.</p>

<p>In the list of musical instruments of Sir Thomas Kytson,
of Hengrave Hall, about the year 1600, recorded in the “History
and Antiquities of Hengrave, Suffolk,” by John Gage,
London, 1822, is mentioned “A Curtall,” which was probably
the <dfn>corthol</dfn> or French <dfn>courtaut</dfn>, an early kind of bassoon, a specimen
of which, dating from the fifteenth century, is preserved
in the Conservatoire de Musique at Paris. According to
Prætorius (anno 1619) the <dfn>fagotto piccolo</dfn>, a small species of
bassoon, was called in England <dfn>single corthol</dfn>.</p>

<p>The invention of the <dfn>serpent</dfn> (<a href="#fig_74">Fig. 74</a>) is attributed to Edme
Guillaume, a canon of Auxerre in France, anno 1590. It was,
however, no new invention, properly speaking, but merely
an improvement upon the old <dfn>Basszinken</dfn>, the management
of which was rendered more convenient by giving a serpentine
winding to the tube. This instrument subsequently became
rather popular. It was used in military bands and in processions
until about the middle of the last century. The
French made use of it also in church to support the voices.
Towards the end of the eighteenth century it appears to have
still been a common substitute for the organ in France.
Dr. Burney, in his “Journal,” London, 1773, states that he
frequently met with it in the churches of that country, and he
expresses a more favourable opinion of its suitableness for
promoting edification than might have been expected from a
refined musician:&mdash;&#8203;"It gives the tone in chanting, and plays
the bass when they sing in parts. It is often ill-played, but
if judiciously used would have a good effect. It is, however,
in general overblown, and too powerful for the voices it
accompanies; otherwise, it mixes with them better than the
organ, as it can augment or diminish a sound with more delicacy,
and is less likely to overpower or destroy, by a bad
temperament, that perfect one of which the voice only is
capable."</p>

<p>The <dfn>serinette</dfn>, or bird organ (<a href="#fig_75">Fig. 75</a>), was formerly used in
France by ladies to teach airs to little singing birds, especially
to a kind of siskin or canary, called in French <dfn>serin</dfn>; hence the
name of the instrument.</p>

<p>The <dfn>organ positive</dfn> (<a href="#fig_76">Fig. 76</a>) is distinguished from the <dfn>organ
portative</dfn> in so far that the former was a larger instrument,
generally placed on a table and blown by an attendant,
while the latter was carried about by the performer in religious
processions and on such-like occasions.</p>

<p>In England some rude species of organ is said to have been
used in public worship as early as about the middle of the
seventh century. It was, however, on the Continent, principally
in Germany, that almost all the important improvements
originated which gradually brought the organ to its
present high degree of perfection. Many old organs of fine workmanship
are still extant in the churches of Germany. During
the 18th century especially several large organs of deserved
celebrity were built in that country; suffice it to instance
those of the brothers Andreas and Gottfried Silbermann. In
England the important inventions of the continental builders
were not readily adopted. Recently, however, several huge
organs of very fine workmanship have been constructed in
England, chiefly for use in concert rooms, or public halls.</p>

<p>The <dfn>regal</dfn>, often mentioned in English literature of the
time of Shakespeare, and earlier (<dfn>see also</dfn> <a href="#Page_96">p. 96</a>), was a small
<!--Pg 235--><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pageno">130</span>
<dfn>organ portative</dfn>. There was till about the end of the 18th
century a “Tuner of the Regals,” in the Chapel Royal <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
James’s, with a salary of 56<abbr title="pounds" class="decoration">l.</abbr> The name <dfn>regal</dfn> is supposed
to have been derived from <dfn>rigabello</dfn>, a musical instrument
of which scarcely more is known than that it was played
in the churches of Italy before the introduction of the
organ.</p>

<p>The expression “a payre of regalls,” used by writers some
centuries ago, evidently implies only a single instrument.
Thus also the virginal is not unfrequently mentioned as “a
payre of virginalls.” Moreover, it appears that the regal
was occasionally made with two sets of pipes, so as to constitute
a double organ of its kind.</p>

<p>In the following lines from Sir W. Leighton’s “Teares or
Lamentations of a Sorrowful Soule,” London, 1613, this little
organ is mentioned in combination with other curious instruments
now antiquated, most of which will be found in the
present collection:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The <dfn>bagpipe</dfn> (<a href="#fig_77">Fig. 77</a>) appears to have been from time
immemorial a special favourite instrument with the Celtic
races; but it was perhaps quite as much admired by the
Slavonic nations. In Poland, and in the Ukraine, it used to be
made of the whole skin of the goat in which the shape of the
animal, whenever the bagpipe was expanded with air, appeared
fully retained exhibiting even the head with the horns; hence
the bagpipe was called <dfn>kosà</dfn>, which signifies a goat.</p>

<p>The bagpipe is of high antiquity in Ireland, and is alluded to
in Irish poetry and prose said to date from the tenth century.
A pig gravely engaged in playing the bagpipe is represented in
an illuminated Irish manuscript, of the year 1300.</p>

<p>The <dfn>bell</dfn> has always been so much in popular favour in
England that some account of it must not be omitted. Paul
Hentzner, a German, who visited England in the year 1598,
records in his journal: “The people are vastly fond of great
noises that fill the ear, such as firing of cannon, drums, and the
ringing of bells; so that in London it is common for a number
of them that have got a glass in their heads to go up into some
belfry, and ring the bells for hours together for the sake of
exercise.” This may be exaggeration,&mdash;&#8203;not unusual with
travellers. It is, however, a fact that bell-ringing has been a
favourite amusement with Englishmen for centuries.</p>

<p>The way in which church bells are suspended and fastened,
so as to permit of their being made to vibrate in the most
effective manner without damaging by their vibration the
building in which they are placed, is in some countries very
peculiar. The Italian <dfn>campanile</dfn>, or bell tower, is not unfrequently
separated from the church itself. In Servia the
church bells are often hung in a frame-work of timber built
near the west end of the church. In Zante and other islands of
Greece the belfry is usually separate from the church. The
reason assigned by the Greeks for having adopted this plan is
that in case of an earthquake the bells are likely to fall and,
were they placed in a tower, would destroy the roof of the
church and might cause the destruction of the whole building.
Also in Russia a special edifice for the bells is generally separate
from the church. In the Russian villages the bells are not
unfrequently hung in the branches of an oak-tree near the
church. In Iceland the bell is usually placed in the lych-gate
leading to the graveyard.</p>

<p>The idea of forming of a number of bells a musical instrument
such as the <dfn>carillon</dfn> is said by some to have suggested
itself first to the English and Dutch; but what we have seen in
Asiatic countries sufficiently refutes this. Moreover, not only
<!--Pg 239--><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pageno">132</span>
the Romans employed variously arranged and attuned bells,
but also among the Etruscan antiquities an instrument has
been discovered which is constructed of a number of bronze
vessels placed in a row on a metal rod. Numerous bells,
varying in size and tone, have also been found in Etruscan
tombs. Among the later contrivances of this kind in European
countries the sets of bells suspended in a wooden frame,
which we find in mediæval illuminations, deserve notice. In
the British Museum is a manuscript of the fourteenth century
in which King David is depicted holding in each hand a hammer
with which he strikes upon bells of different dimensions,
suspended on a wooden stand.</p>

<p>It may be supposed that the device of playing tunes by means
of bells merely swung by the hand is also of ancient date. In
Lancashire each of the ringers manages two bells, holding one
in either hand. Thus, an assemblage of seven ringers insures
fourteen different tones; and as each ringer may change his
two notes by substituting two other Dells if required, even
compositions with various modulations, and of a somewhat
intricate character, may be executed,&mdash;&#8203;provided the ringers
are good timeists; for each has, of course, to take care to fall in
with his note, just as a member of the Russian horn band
contributes his single note whenever it occurs.</p>

<p>Peal-ringing is another pastime of the kind which may be
regarded as pre-eminently national to England. The bells
constituting a peal are frequently of the number of eight,
attuned to the diatonic scale. Also peals of ten bells, and
even of twelve, are occasionally formed. A peculiar feature
of peal-ringing is that the bells, which are provided with
clappers, are generally swung so forcibly as to raise the
mouth completely upwards. The largest peal, and one of
the finest, is at Exeter Cathedral: another celebrated one
is that of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Margaret’s, Leicester, which consists of ten
<!--Pg 240--><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pageno">133</span>
bells. Peal-ringing is of an early date in England; Egelric,
abbot of Croyland, is recorded to have cast about the year 960
a set of six bells.</p>

<p>The <dfn>carillon</dfn> is especially popular in the Netherlands and
Belgium, but is also found in Germany, Italy, and some
other European countries. It is generally placed in the
church tower, and also sometimes in other public edifices. The
statement repeated by several writers that the first carillon
was invented in the year 1481 in the town of Alost is not
to be trusted, for the town of Bruges claims to have possessed
similar chimes in the year 1300. There are two kinds of
carillons in use on the Continent, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: clock chimes, which
are moved by machinery, like a self-acting barrel-organ;
and such as are provided with a set of keys, by means of
which the tunes are played by a musician. The carillon in
the “Parochial-Kirche” at Berlin, which is one of the finest
in Germany, contains thirty-seven bells; and is provided
with a key-board for the hands and with a pedal, which
together place at the disposal of the performer a compass of
rather more than three octaves. The keys of the manual are
metal rods somewhat above a foot in length, and are pressed
down with the palms of the hand. The keys of the pedal are
of wood; the instrument requires not only great dexterity,
but also a considerable physical power. It is astonishing
how rapidly passages can be executed upon it by the player,
who is generally the organist of the church in which he acts
as <dfn>carillonneur</dfn>. When engaged in the last-named capacity
he usually wears leathern gloves to protect his fingers, as
they are otherwise apt to become ill fit for the more delicate
treatment of the organ.</p>

<p>The want of a contrivance in the <dfn>carillon</dfn> for stopping the
vibration has the effect of making rapid passages, if heard
near, sound as a confused noise; only at some distance are
<!--Pg 241--><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pageno">134</span>
they tolerable. It must be remembered that the <dfn>carillon</dfn>
is intended especially to be heard from a distance. Successions
of tones which form a consonant chord, and which
have some duration, are evidently the most suitable for this
instrument.</p>

<p>Indeed, every musical instrument possesses certain characteristics
which render it especially suitable for the production
of some particular effects. The invention of a new instrument
of music has, therefore, not unfrequently led to the
adoption of new effects in compositions. Take the pianoforte,
which was invented in the beginning of the eighteenth
century, and which has now obtained so great a popularity;
its characteristics inspired our great composers to the invention
of effects, or expressions, which cannot be properly
rendered on any other instrument, however superior in some
respects it may be to the pianoforte. Thus also the improvements
which have been made during the present century
in the construction of our brass instruments, and the invention
of several new brass instruments, have evidently
been not without influence upon the conceptions displayed in
our modern orchestral works.</p>

<p>Imperfect though this essay may be it will probably have
convinced the reader that a reference to the history of the
music of different nations elucidates many facts illustrative
of our own musical instruments, which to the unprepared
observer must appear misty and impenetrable. In truth,
it is with this study as with any other scientific pursuit.
The unassisted eye sees only faint nebulæ, where with the aid
of the telescope bright stars are revealed.</p>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="sc">Handel’s Harpsichord.</span></h4>

<p class="p2">The following documentary evidence of this instrument’s
authenticity as Handel’s harpsichord (<a href="#fig_78">Fig. 78</a>) has been transmitted
by Messrs. Broadwood:&mdash;</p>

<p class="sigright">33, Great Pulteney Street, London,<br />
<span class="decoration r3">November 18th, 1868.</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">Handel’s harpsichord was bought by us of Mr. Hooper, a
pianoforte tuner at Winchester, in 1852. He had obtained it
from Dr. Chard, the Cathedral organist of that city, who had
taken pains to prove it to be the same instrument which
Handel had left by will to his friend and amanuensis, Christopher
Smith. In Handel’s will, dated June, 1750, was the
bequest:&mdash;&#8203;‘I give and bequeath to Christopher Smith my
large harpsichord, my little house-organ, my music books,
and 500<abbr title="pounds" class="decoration">l.</abbr> sterling;’ and in a codicil, dated 6th of August,
1756: ‘I give to Christopher Smith 1,500<abbr title="pounds" class="decoration">l.</abbr> additional to the
legacy already given to him in my will.’ Dr. Chard wrote to
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> George Coxe, of Twyford (Rector of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s,
Winchester), to obtain his testimony to the identity of this
harpsichord with the ‘<dfn>Large Harpsichord</dfn>’ of the will. Mr.
Coxe was nearly related to Smith, and had frequently heard
him play upon it. On the 13th of May, 1842, and in the
presence of witnesses, Mr. Coxe confirmed this. Dr. Chard
states in the document signed by Mr. Coxe, that this harpsichord
was left with a large collection of Handel’s <abbr title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr> by
Christopher Smith to his step-daughter, the Dowager Lady
Rivers, who parted with it to Mr. Wickham, a surgeon, who,
in his turn, parted with it to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Hawtrey, Prebendary
of Winchester, after whose death it came into the possession
of Dr. Chard.</p>
<!--Pg 245--><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pageno">136</span>

<p class="blockquote">This interesting relic of Handel is also worthy of notice
from having been one of the best-constructed instruments of
the celebrated harpsichord makers, the Ruckers family of
Antwerp. It is not remarkable for any beauty of decoration
beyond the conventional ornamentation of the period; but
the structure shows great skill in the manufacture, and that
the harpsichord had become nearly perfected in the middle
of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The two key-boards were used for variety of tone. The
lower key-board, the <dfn>jacks</dfn> of which acted upon two sets of
strings in unison, and one set an octave higher, was the louder
in tone; the upper key-board, acting on one set of strings
only, was the softer. But the lower key-board could be made
to act upon one set of strings only, by means of stops drawn
out by the hand of the performer. In touching the keys, a
distinctive quality of tone may still be recognised, particularly
in the higher notes, a reedy but soft and delicate <dfn>timbre</dfn> testifying
to the former beauty of the instrument. It may be
assumed as certain that the keys are not of Handel’s time.
We do not know when the present key-boards were put, or
by whom, but the style of the white and black keys is undoubtedly
modern. Neither can it be doubted that there
were originally keys in keeping with the fashion of the harpsichord,
which we may suppose to have been worn out, to
account for the substitution of those existing. The case of
deal, black japanned, the brass hinges, the ornamentation,
and the mottoes are original. Inside the top is inscribed:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

It is not now capable of being tuned, and any attempt to

consequence to the preservation of the woodwork that tuning
should not be attempted.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The celebrated Mr. Smith (or Schmidt) was Handel’s
private friend, and amanuensis. This said Mr. Smith was
presented by Handel with his favourite fine double-keyed
harpsichord, made by the best makers of the day, Andreas
Ruckers of Antwerpia, 1651. This said instrument you
have heard repeatedly Mr. Smith play on. Mr. Smith was
father-in-law to you as well as your sister, the late Dowager
Lady Rivers; and at his death, the said harpsichord, together
with a large collection of Handel’s oratorios, etc., etc., <abbr title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr>,
came into the hands of the Dowager Lady Rivers. This instrument
was parted with to a Mr. Wickham, surgeon, who
parted with it to the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> W. Hawtrey, Prebendary of Winchester
Cathedral, upon the death of whom I purchased it at
the sale of his effects; and in my possession it still remains.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
